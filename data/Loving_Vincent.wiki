==Plot==
One year after [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s suicide, postman  [[The Roulin Family#Joseph|Joseph Roulin]] asks his son [[The Roulin Family#Armand|Armand]] to deliver Van Gogh's last letter to his brother, [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]]. Roulin finds the death suspicious, as merely weeks earlier Van Gogh claimed through letters that his mood was calm and normal. Armand reluctantly agrees and heads for Paris.

[[Père Tanguy]], a [[Montmartre]] art supplier, tells Armand that Theo actually died six months after Vincent. He suggests that Armand travel to [[Auvers-sur-Oise]] and look for [[Paul Gachet|Dr. Paul Gachet]], who housed Van Gogh after his release from an asylum, shared his love for art, and attended the funeral. Once there, Armand learns that the doctor is out on business. So he stays at [[Auberge Ravoux|the same inn]] that Van Gogh did during his time in the area. There he meets the temporary proprietress [[Portraits by Vincent van Gogh#Adeline Ravoux|Adeline Ravoux]], who was fond of Van Gogh and who was also surprised by his death. At her suggestion, Armand visits the local boatman, who informs him that Van Gogh kept close company with Dr. Gachet's sheltered daughter, Marguerite. When Armand visits her, Marguerite denies and is angered when Armand implies that Van Gogh's suicidal mood could have resulted from an argument with her father.

Throughout the investigation, Armand begins to suspect a local boy named René Secretan, who reportedly liked to torment Van Gogh, was in possession of a gun, and had often drunkenly waved it around town. Dr. Mazery, who examined Van Gogh, also claims that the shot must have come from a few feet away, ruling out suicide. When Armand implicates René, Marguerite confesses that she was in close, but not romantic, relations with Van Gogh, but she does not believe that René was capable of murder.

Dr. Gachet finally returns and promises to deliver Armand's letter to Theo's widow. He admits there was an argument between them – Van Gogh accused Gachet of being a coward for not pursuing his dreams, to which Gachet angrily accused Van Gogh of deteriorating Theo's health by overly depending on his brother. Gachet posits that this accusation drove Van Gogh to suicide in order to release Theo from the burden. After Armand returns home, Postman Roulin later receives word from Theo's widow, [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Johanna]], thanking Armand for returning the letter. Johanna attaches to her letter to Armand one of van Gogh's letters to her – signed, "Your loving Vincent."

==Production==
The filmmakers chose classically trained painters over traditional animators. Welchman said he wanted to avoid animators with "personalised styles" and opted for people who "were very pure oil painters".<ref name="Cartoonbrew">{{cite web|last1=Vollenbroek|first1=Tunde|title=‘Loving Vincent’: 6 Facts About The First Oil Painted Animated Feature|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/loving-vincent-6-facts-first-oil-painted-animated-feature-150443.html|website=Cartoon Brew|accessdate=26 October 2017}}</ref> In total there were 125 painters from over twenty countries, which was more than envisioned and due to a difficulty in obtaining funding, resulting in a shorter schedule for the crew to work within. There were, in total, about 5,000 applicants, many of whom became interested after watching an online "recruitment teaser" for the project.<ref name="Cartoonbrew" />

Van Gogh paintings informed the [[storyboard]] for the project, which were modified for the screen. These modifications ranged from simple alterations to re-imaginings incorporating different weather effects or time of day.<ref name="Cartoonbrew"/> A total of 65,000 frames were painted, but since artists painted multiple frames from the same shot on a single surface, only 1,000 paintings survived.<ref name="Cartoonbrew"/>

The film uses a form of [[rotoscoping]]. Production for the film began with a live-action cast filming against a [[green screen]]. After filming, editors composited Van Gogh paintings into scene backgrounds, and finally cut the movie together as usual. However, once the actual film was complete, they shot each individual frame onto a blank canvas, and artists painted over each image. The entire process, from the actual filming to completion of the paintings, took four years to finish. Even Welchman himself admitted, "We have definitely without a doubt invented the slowest form of filmmaking ever devised in 120 years."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/loving-vincent-entirely-hand-painted-film-about-vincent-van-goghs-life/ | title="Loving Vincent" Van Gogh: How the world's first hand-painted film was made | date=21 October 2017 | publisher=CBS News | accessdate=10 August 2018 }}</ref>

==Reception==

===Box office===
The movie is considered a box office success, grossing over an estimated $42.1 million (in USD) worldwide on a budget of $5.5 million, with United States earnings totaling $6.7 million. The film has most notably grossed $3 million in South Korea, $2.1 million in Italy and $10.8 million in China.<ref name="variety20mill">{{cite web|last1=Hopewell|first1=John|title=‘Loving Vincent’ Passes $20 Million at Worldwide Box Office|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/global/loving-vincent-passes-20-million-worldwide-box-office-1202635407/|website=Variety|accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref>

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 85% based on 141 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website's critical consensus states, "''Loving Vincent''{{'}}s dazzling visual achievements make this Van Gogh biopic well worth seeking out – even if its narrative is far less effectively composed."<ref name="rt">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/loving_vincent/|title=Loving Vincent (2017)|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=12 January 2019}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] reports a score of 62 out of 100 based on 21 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref name="mc">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/loving-vincent|title=Loving Vincent Reviews|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref>

[[A. O. Scott]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', found the visual aspects of the film to be innovative stating: "the viewer also becomes accustomed to the images, and astonishment at the film's innovative, painstaking technique begins to fade. But its charm never quite wears off, for reasons summed up in the title."<ref>A.&nbsp;O. Scott. Film Review. ''The New York Times''. 21 September 2017.</ref> Actress [[Angourie Rice]] had similar sentiments, writing in an essay that “it was such a fascinating experience to witness the actors’ performances turned into van Gogh style paintings. The great thing about this film is that it also made me question what the merging of artforms meant for art, film, and everything in between.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thoughtstokeepmesane.wordpress.com/2018/01/20/loving-vincent/|title=Loving Vincent|first=|last=Angourie|date=20 January 2018|website=wordpress.com}}</ref>

Giuseppe Sedia of the ''[[Krakow Post]]'' praised the impressive visual style of the movie. However, he added, "In their concern to keep the viewers interested, directors Kobiela and Welchman have built an over-narrated and spirit-dampening movie in which the preponderance of the dialogues hinders the viewers’ immersion into the violent beauty and materiality of Van Gogh’s oeuvre". <ref>{{Cite web|author= Sedia, Giuseppe|date=15 October 2017|title=Loving Vincent (2017)|url= http://www.krakowpost.com/18287/2017/10/kino-mania-loving-vincent-2017|work=[[Krakow Post]]|accessdate=11 December 2018}}</ref>
