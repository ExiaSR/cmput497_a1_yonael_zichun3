'''''The Incredibles''''' is a 2004 American [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] <!--Please do not add "comedy" or any other genres here. We use the most general category for the lead.-->[[superhero film]] written and directed by [[Brad Bird]], produced by [[Pixar Animation Studios]], released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]], and starring the voices of [[Craig T. Nelson]], [[Holly Hunter]], [[Sarah Vowell]], [[Spencer Fox]], [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], and [[Elizabeth Peña]]. Set in an

Mr. Incredible's desire to help people draws the entire family into a confrontation with a vengeful fan-turned-foe and his killer robot.

Bird, who was Pixar's first outside director, developed the film as an extension of the 1960s comic books and [[spy film]]s from his boyhood and personal family life. He pitched the film to Pixar after the box office disappointment of his first feature, ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (1999), and carried over much of its staff to develop ''The Incredibles''. The animation team was tasked with animating an all-human cast, which required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing and realistic skin and hair. [[Michael Giacchino]] composed the film's [[orchestral]] score.

The film premiered on October 27, 2004, at the [[BFI London Film Festival]] and had its general release in the United States on November 5, 2004. It performed well at the box office, grossing $633 million worldwide during its original theatrical run. ''The Incredibles'' received widespread approval from critics and audiences, winning two [[Academy Awards]] and the [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature]]. It was the first entirely animated film to win the prestigious [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]]. A sequel, ''[[Incredibles 2]]'', was released on June 15, 2018.

== Plot ==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->
Public opinion turns against Superheroes due to the collateral damage caused by their crime-fighting. After several lawsuits, the government initiates the Superhero Relocation Program, which forces Supers to permanently adhere to their [[Secret identity|secret identities]] and criminalizes their exploits. Fifteen years later, Bob and Helen Parr—formerly known as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl—and their children Violet, Dash, and baby Jack-Jack are a suburban family living in Metroville. Although he loves his family, Bob resents the mundanity of his suburban lifestyle and white-collar job. Together with his best friend Lucius Best, formerly known as Frozone, Bob occasionally relives "the glory days" by moonlighting as a vigilante.

After his supervisor prevents him from stopping a mugging, Bob loses his temper and injures him, resulting in his dismissal. Returning home, Bob receives a message from a woman called Mirage, who gives him a mission to destroy a savage tripod-like robot, the Omnidroid, on the remote island of Nomanisan. Mr. Incredible battles and disables it by tricking it into ripping out its own power source.

Mr. Incredible finds the action and higher pay rejuvenating. He improves his relationship with his family and begins rigorous physical training while awaiting another assignment from Mirage over the next two months. Finding a tear in his super suit, he visits superhero costume designer [[Edna Mode]] to have it mended. Assuming that Helen knows what Bob is doing, Edna also makes suits for the rest of the family. Setting out for Nomanisan once again, Mr. Incredible discovers Mirage is working for Buddy Pine, a disaffected former fan whom he had rejected as his sidekick. Having adopted the alias of Syndrome, he has been perfecting the Omnidroid by hiring different superheroes to fight it, killing them in the process. Syndrome intends to send the perfected Omnidroid to Metroville, where he will secretly manipulate its controls to defeat it in public, becoming a "hero" himself. He will later sell his inventions so that everyone can become "super", rendering the difference meaningless.

Helen visits Edna and learns what Bob has been up to. She activates a beacon Edna built into the suits to find Mr. Incredible, inadvertently causing him to be captured while infiltrating Syndrome's base. Elastigirl borrows a private plane to travel to Nomanisan. She finds out that Violet and Dash have stowed away, leaving Jack-Jack with a babysitter. Elastigirl's radio transmissions are picked up by Syndrome, who sends missiles to shoot her down. The plane is destroyed, but Elastigirl and the kids survive and use their powers to reach the island. Helen infiltrates the base and discovers Syndrome's plan. Discontented with Syndrome's indifference when her life was threatened, Mirage releases Mr. Incredible and informs him of his family's survival. Helen arrives and races off with Mr. Incredible to find their children. Dash and Violet are chased by Syndrome's guards, but fend them off with their powers before reuniting with their parents. Syndrome captures them all, leaving them imprisoned while he follows the rocket transporting the Omnidroid to Metroville.

The Incredibles escape to Metroville in another rocket with Mirage's help. As per its programming, the Omnidroid recognizes Syndrome as a threat and shoots off the remote control on his wrist, making him incapable of controlling it and knocking him unconscious. The Incredibles and Frozone fight the Omnidroid together. Elastigirl acquires the remote control, allowing Mr. Incredible to use one of the robot's claws to destroy its power source. Returning home, the Incredibles find Syndrome, who plans to kidnap Jack-Jack and raise him as his own sidekick out of revenge. As Syndrome flies up toward his jet, Jack-Jack's own superpowers start to manifest and he escapes Syndrome in midair. Elastigirl catches Jack-Jack, and Mr. Incredible throws his car at Syndrome's plane as he is about to board. Syndrome is sucked into the jet's turbine by his own cape, killing him, and the plane explodes.

Three months later, the Incredibles witness the arrival of a supervillain called the Underminer. They put on their superhero masks, ready to face the new threat together as a family.<!-- We do not link teaser campaigns as per talk discussion but DO NOT REMOVE IT. -->

== Production ==
=== Writing ===
''The Incredibles'' as a concept dates back to 1993 when Bird sketched the family during an uncertain point in his film career.<ref name="dvdint1">{{cite video |people=Brad Bird, John Walker |title=The Incredibles. Special Features: Making of The Incredibles |medium=[[Blu-ray Disc]] |publisher=Buena Vista Home Entertainment |year=2011 |display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name="IGNint" /> Personal issues had percolated into the story as they weighed on him in life.<ref name="PixarTouch03" /> During this time, Bird had signed a production deal with [[Warner Bros. Animation|Warner Bros. Feature Animation]] and was in the process of directing his first feature, ''[[The Iron Giant]]''.<ref name="PixarTouch02" /> Approaching middle age and having high aspirations for his filmmaking, Bird pondered whether his career goals were attainable only at the price of his family life.<ref name="PixarTouch03" /> He stated, "Consciously, this was just a funny movie about superheroes. But I think that what was going on in my life definitely filtered into the movie."<ref>Paik, Karen. (2007) ''To Infinity and Beyond!: The Story of Pixar Animation Studios,'' Chronicle Books LLC, pg. 236–37.</ref> After the box office failure of ''The Iron Giant'', Bird gravitated toward his superhero story.<ref name="PixarTouch03">Price, p. 220</ref><ref name="PixarTouch02">Price, p. 219</ref>

He imagined it as a homage to the 1960s comic books and [[spy film]]s from his boyhood and he initially tried to develop it as a [[Traditional animation#Cels|2D cel animation]].<ref name="PixarTouch03" /> When ''The Iron Giant'' became a [[box office bomb]], he reconnected with old friend [[John Lasseter]] at [[Pixar]] in March 2000 and pitched his story idea to him.<ref name="IGNint" /> Bird and Lasseter knew each other from their college years at [[California Institute of the Arts|CalArts]] in the 1970s.<ref name="PixarTouch04" /> Lasseter was sold on the idea and convinced Bird to come to Pixar, where the film would be done in [[computer animation]]. The studio announced a multi-film contract with Bird on May 4, 2000.<ref name="PixarTouch03" /> ''The Incredibles'' was written and directed solely by Brad Bird, a departure from previous Pixar productions which typically had two or three directors and as many screenwriters with a history of working for the company.<ref name="PixarTouch06">Price, p. 222</ref> In addition, it would be the company's first film in which all characters are human.<ref name="PixarTouch04">Price, p. 217</ref>

{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote="The dad is always expected in the family to be strong, so I made him strong. The moms are always pulled in a million different directions, so I made her stretch like taffy. Teenagers, particularly teenage girls, are insecure and defensive, so I made her turn invisible and turn on shields. And ten-year-old boys are hyperactive energy balls. Babies are unrealized potential."|source=–&nbsp;Brad Bird, writer and director of ''The Incredibles''.<ref name="PixarTouch05">Price, p. 220–221</ref><ref name="barrier" />}}
Bird came to Pixar with the lineup of the story's family members worked out: a mom and dad, both suffering through the dad's midlife crisis; a shy teenage girl; a cocky ten-year-old boy; and a baby. Bird had based their powers on family archetypes.<ref name="PixarTouch03" /><ref name="barrier" /><ref name="PixarTouch10">Price, p. 221</ref> During production, [[Hayao Miyazaki]] of [[Studio Ghibli]] visited Pixar and saw the film's story reels. When Bird asked if the reels made any sense or if they were just "American nonsense," Miyazaki replied, through an interpreter, "I think it's a very adventurous thing you are trying to do in an American film."<ref name="PixarTouch01">Price, p. 215–216</ref>

Syndrome was originally written as a minor villain who assaults Bob and Helen at the beginning of the movie, only to die in a explosion that destroys the Parrs' house (in this version, the Smiths), but he was made the main villain because the filmmakers liked him more than the character of Xerek, who was intended to fulfill that role. The Snug character that Helen talks to at the phone in the final film was intended to fly Helen to Nomanisan Island and to die, but he was removed from that position when Lasseter suggested to have Helen pilot the plane herself.<ref name="commentary">''Finding Nemo'', 2004 DVD, commentary</ref>

=== Animation ===
[[File:Brad bird cropped 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Brad Bird]] wrote and directed the film.]]
Upon Pixar's acceptance of the project, Brad Bird was asked to bring in his own team for the production. He brought up a core group of people he worked with on ''The Iron Giant''. Because of this, many 2-D artists had to make the shift to 3-D, including Bird himself. Bird found working with CG "wonderfully malleable" in a way that traditional animation is not, calling the camera's ability to easily switch angles in a given scene "marvelously adaptable." He found working in computer animation "difficult" in a different way than working traditionally, finding the software "sophisticated and not particularly friendly."<ref name="aniworld" /> Bird wrote the script without knowing the limitations or concerns that went hand-in-hand with the medium of computer animation. As a result, this was to be the most complex film yet for Pixar.<ref name="dvdint1" /> The film's characters were designed by Tony Fucile and [[Teddy Newton]], whom Bird had brought with him from Warner Bros.<ref name="PixarTouch07" /> Like most computer-animated films, ''The Incredibles'' had a year-long period of building the film from the inside out: modeling the exterior and understanding controls that would work the face and the body—the articulation of the character—before animation could even begin.<ref name="aniworld" /> Bird and Fucile tried to emphasize the graphic quality of good 2-D animation to the Pixar team, who had only worked primarily in CG. Bird attempted to incorporate teaching from [[Disney's Nine Old Men]] that the crew at Pixar had "never really emphasized."<ref name="aniworld">{{cite web |url=http://www.awn.com/articles/reviews/brad-bird-pixar-tackle-cg-humans-true-superheroes |title=Brad Bird & Pixar Tackle CG Humans Like True Superheroes |publisher=AnimationWorld |date=November 5, 2004 |accessdate=July 31, 2012 |author=Bill Desowitz}}</ref>

For the technical crew members, the film's human characters posed a difficult set of challenges.<ref name="PixarTouch06" /> Bird's story was filled with elements that were difficult to animate with [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] back then. Humans are widely considered to be the most difficult things to execute in animation.<ref name="IGNint" /> Pixar's animators filmed themselves walking to better grasp proper human motion.<ref name=IGNint>{{cite news |last=Patrizio |first=Andy |title=An Interview with Brad Bird |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/03/10/an-interview-with-brad-bird |accessdate=July 27, 2013 |newspaper=IGN |date=March 9, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120195157/http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/03/10/an-interview-with-brad-bird |archivedate=January 20, 2013}}</ref> Creating an all-human cast required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing, and realistic skin and hair. Although the technical team had some experience with hair and cloth in ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' (2001), the amount of hair and cloth required for ''The Incredibles'' had never been done by Pixar up until this point. Moreover, Bird would tolerate no compromises for the sake of technical simplicity. Where the technical team on ''Monsters, Inc.'' had persuaded director [[Pete Docter]] to accept pigtails on Boo to make her hair easier to animate, the character Violet had to have long hair that obscured her face; in fact, this was integral to her character.<ref name="PixarTouch06" /> Violet's long hair, which was extremely difficult to animate, was only successfully animated toward the end of production. In addition, animators had to adapt to having hair both underwater and blowing through the wind.<ref name="aniworld" /> Disney was initially reluctant to make the film because of these issues, thinking that a live-action film would be preferable, but Lasseter denied this.<ref name="infinity" />

{{Quote box
|quote = ''The Incredibles'' was everything that computer-generated animation had trouble doing. It had human characters, it had hair, it had water, it had fire, it had a massive number of sets. The creative heads were excited about the idea of the film, but once I showed story reels of exactly what I wanted, the technical teams turned white. They took one look and thought, “This will take ten years and cost $500 million. How are we possibly going to do this?”

So I said, “Give us the black sheep. I want artists who are frustrated. I want the ones who have another way of doing things that nobody’s listening to. Give us all the guys who are probably headed out the door.” A lot of them were malcontents because they saw different ways of doing things, but there was little opportunity to try them, since the established way was working very, very well.

We gave the black sheep a chance to prove their theories, and we changed the way a number of things are done here. For less money per minute than was spent on the previous film, Finding Nemo, we did a movie that had three times the number of sets and had everything that was hard to do. All this because the heads of Pixar gave us leave to try crazy ideas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/innovation-lessons-from-pixar-an-interview-with-oscar-winning-director-brad-bird |title=Innovation lessons from Pixar: An interview with Oscar-winning director Brad Bird |last=Rao |first=Hayagreeva |last2=Sutton |first2=Robert |last3=Webb |first3=Allen P. |date=April 2008 |website=McKinsey Quarterly |publisher=McKinsey & Company |access-date=19 November 2018}}</ref>

Not only did ''The Incredibles'' cope with the difficulty of animating CG humans, but also many other complications. The story was bigger than any prior story at the studio, was longer in running time, and had four times the number of locations.<ref name="aniworld" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Collins |first=Andrew |title=Interview: Pixar's Pete Docter and Jonas Rivera |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/blogs/759-andrew-collins-pixar-up-pete-docter-jonas-rivera/ |accessdate=July 27, 2013 |newspaper=Radio Times |date=October 5, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511111625/http://www.radiotimes.com/blogs/759-andrew-collins-pixar-up-pete-docter-jonas-rivera/ |archivedate=May 11, 2011}}</ref> Supervising technical director Rick Sayre noted that the hardest thing about the film was that there was "no hardest thing," alluding to the amount of new technical challenges: fire, water, air, smoke, steam, and explosions were all additional to the new difficulty of working with humans.<ref name="aniworld" /> The film's organizational structure could not be mapped out like previous Pixar features, and it became a running joke to the team.<ref name="aniworld" /> Sayre said the team adopted “Alpha Omega," where one team was concerned with building modeling, shading, and layout, while another dealt with final camera, lighting, and effects. Another team, dubbed the "character team," digitally sculpted, rigged, and shaded all of the characters, and a simulation team was responsible for developing simulation technology for hair and clothing.<ref name="aniworld" /> There were at least 781 visual effects shots in the film, and they were quite often visual gags, such as the window shattering when Bob angrily shuts the car door. Additionally, the effects team improved their modeling of clouds, using volumetric rendering for the first time.<ref name="aniworld" />

The skin of the characters gained a new level of realism from a technology to produce known as "[[subsurface scattering]]."<ref name="PixarTouch07">Price, p. 223</ref> The challenges did not stop with modeling humans. Bird decided that in a shot near the film's end, baby Jack-Jack would have to undergo a series of transformations, and in one of the five planned he would turn himself into a kind of goo. Technical directors, who anticipated spending two months or even longer to work out the goo effect, stealing precious hours from production that had already entered its final and most critical stages, petitioned the film's producer, John Walker, for help.<ref name="PixarTouch08" /> Bird, who had himself brought Walker over from Warner Bros. to work on the project, was at first immovable, but after arguing with Walker in several invective-laced meetings over the course of two months, Bird finally conceded.<ref name="PixarTouch08">Price, p. 224</ref> Bird also insisted that the storyboards define the blocking of characters' motions, lighting, and camera movements, which had previously been left to other departments rather than storyboarded.<ref name="PixarTouch06" />

Bird admitted that he "had the knees of [the studio] trembling under the weight" of ''The Incredibles'', but called the film a "testament to the talent of the animators at Pixar," who were admiring the challenges the film provoked.<ref name="aniworld" /> He recalled, "Basically, I came into a wonderful studio, frightened a lot of people with how many presents I wanted for Christmas, and then got almost everything I asked for."<ref name="infinity">Paik, Karen.

=== Music ===
{{Main|The Incredibles (film score)}}
''The Incredibles'' is the first Pixar film to be scored by [[Michael Giacchino]]. Brad Bird was looking for a specific sound as inspired by the film's [[retrofuturistic]] design&nbsp;– the future as seen from the 1960s. [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] was the first choice to do the film's score, with a [[trailer (film)|trailer]] of the film given a rerecording of Barry's theme to ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (soundtrack)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''. However, Barry did not wish to duplicate the sound of some of his earlier soundtracks;<ref>{{cite news |title=AICN Animation Double-Header!

Wallin noted that brass instruments, which are at the forefront of the film's score, sound better on analog equipment rather than digital. Wallin came from an era in which music was recorded, according to Giacchino, "the right way", which consists of everyone in the same room, "playing against each other and feeding off each other's energy". Tim Simonec was the conductor/orchestrator for the score's recording.<ref name="dvdint2">{{cite video |people=Brad Bird, Michael Giacchino |title=The Incredibles.

It won numerous awards for best score including [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award]], [[BMI Film & TV Award]], [[ASCAP]] Film and Television Music Award, [[Annie Award]], Las Vegas Film Critics Society Award and [[Online Film Critics Society Award]] and was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media]], [[Satellite Award]] and [[Broadcast Film Critics Association Award]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/287450/The-Incredibles/awards |title=The Incredibles (2004) Awards |work=The New York Times |accessdate=March 7, 2009}}</ref>

The producers of the [[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|2005 adaptation]] of ''Fantastic Four'' were forced to make significant script changes and add more special effects because of similarities to ''The Incredibles''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mania.com/scoop-stretching-end-fantastic-four_article_43221.html |title=SCOOP: Stretching the end of FANTASTIC FOUR |date=December 24, 2004 |author=Patrick Sauriol |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706185802/http://www.mania.com/scoop-stretching-end-fantastic-four_article_43221.html |archivedate=July 6, 2008}}</ref> Bird was not surprised that comparisons arose due to superheroes being "the most well-trod turf on the planet," but noted that he had not been inspired by any comic books specifically, only having heard of ''Watchmen''. He did comment that it was nice to be compared to it, since "if you're going to be compared to something, it's nice if it's something good".<ref name="barrier" />

Some commentators took Bob's frustration with celebrating mediocrity and Syndrome's comment that "when everyone's super, no one will be" as a reflection of views shared by German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] or an extension of [[Russian-American]] novelist [[Ayn Rand]]'s [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] philosophy, which Bird felt was "ridiculous."<ref name="IGNint" /><ref name="barrier">{{cite web |url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Interviews/Bird/Bird_Interview.htm |title=Brad Bird – Interview |publisher=MichaelBarrier.com |date=February 27, 2005 |accessdate=July 31, 2012 |author=Michael Barrier|author-link=Michael Barrier (historian) }}</ref> He stated that a large portion of the audience understood the message as he intended whereas "two percent thought I was doing ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' or ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''." Some purported that ''The Incredibles'' exhibited a right-wing bias, which Bird also scoffed at. "I think that's as silly of an analysis as saying ''The Iron Giant'' was left-wing. I'm definitely a [[centrism|centrist]] and feel like both parties can be absurd."<ref name="IGNint" />

The film also explored Bird's dislike for the tendency of the children's comics and Saturday morning cartoons of his youth to portray villains as unrealistic, ineffectual, and non-threatening.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pratt |first=Douglas |title=The Incredibles DVD Review |url=http://moviecitynews.com/archived/columnists/pratt/2005/incredibles.html |publisher=Movie City News |accessdate=July 30, 2013 |date=March 15, 2005 |quote=There's expectations for animation, and, you know, you make this connection with animation and superheroes, you think, 'Saturday morning,' and Saturday morning they have these very strange shows, completely designed around conflict and yet no one ever dies or gets really injured, or there's no consequence to it. I think that came out of, you know, a team of psychologists determined that it is bad for children, and I think just the opposite. I think that it's better if kids realize there's a cost and that if the hero gets injured and still has to fight, it's more dramatic, and it's closer to life.}}</ref> In the film, Dash and Violet have to deal with villains who are perfectly willing to use deadly force against children.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cobbs |first=Maurice |title=The Incredibles |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/incredibles.php |publisher=DVD Verdict |accessdate=July 30, 2013 |quote=Remember the bad guys on the shows you used to watch on Saturday mornings?" she says.

Despite disagreeing with some analysis, Bird felt it gratifying for his work to be considered on many different levels, which was his intention: "The fact that it was written about in the [[op/ed]] section of ''[[The New York Times]]'' several times was really gratifying to me. Look, it's a mainstream animated movie, and how often are those considered thought provoking?"<ref name="IGNint" />

The Polar Express (Nov. 10), Paramount's The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, and Paramount's Jim Carrey starrer, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events. Harris Nesbitt Gerard analyst Jeffrey Logsdon predicted that The Incredibles will gross $225 million domestically and close to $500 million worldwide – ordinarily a huge result, but well below the $865 million for Pixar's Finding Nemo.
