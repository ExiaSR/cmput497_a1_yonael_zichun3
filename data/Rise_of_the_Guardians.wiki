'''''Rise of the Guardians''''' is a 2012 American [[3D film|3D]] [[Computer-animated film|computer-animated]] [[action film|action]] [[fantasy film]] based on [[William Joyce (writer)|William Joyce]]'s [[The Guardians of Childhood]] book series and ''The Man in the Moon'' short film by Joyce and [[Reel FX Creative Studios]]. [[Peter Ramsey]] directed the film, while Joyce and [[Guillermo del Toro]] were executive producers with voice acting by [[Chris Pine]], [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Isla Fisher]], and [[Jude Law]]. Produced by [[DreamWorks Animation]] and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]],{{ref|1|1}} it was released on November 21, 2012. Despite receiving generally positive reviews and grossing $306 million against its $145 million budget, it was a [[box office bomb]], due to production and marketing costs, losing [[DreamWorks Animation]] $83 million.<ref name="write-down"/><ref name="layoffs"/>

Set about 300 years after the book series, the film tells a story about Guardians [[Santa Claus]], the [[Tooth fairy|Tooth Fairy]], the [[Easter Bunny]], and the [[Sandman]], who enlist [[Jack Frost]] to stop the evil [[Bogeyman|Pitch Black]] from engulfing the world in darkness in a fight of dreams. The film was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Globe|first=Golden|title=Golden Globes 2013: full list of nominations|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/13/golden-globes-2013-nominations-list|accessdate=January 3, 2013|newspaper=guardian.co.uk|date=13 December 2012<!-- 14.32 GMT-->}}</ref> This was the last DreamWorks Animation film to be distributed by Paramount Pictures.<ref name=DeadlineFox /> 

==Plot==
<!-- Due to [[WP:FILMPLOT]], ALL SUMMARIES MUST BE 400 TO 700 WORDS IN LENGTH! The total length is now 501 words; DO NOT ADD UNLESS NECCESSARY!-->

[[Jack Frost]] awakens from a frozen pond with [[amnesia]]. Upon realizing no one can see or hear him, he disappears. Three hundred years later, Jack, as the young Spirit of Winter, enjoys delivering snow days to school kids, but resents that they do not believe in him. At the [[North Pole]], the [[Man in the Moon]] warns [[Santa Claus|Nicholas St. North]] that [[Bogeyman|Pitch Black]] is threatening the children of the world with his nightmares. He calls [[Easter Bunny|E. Aster Bunnymund]], [[Sandman|Sandy]], and [[Tooth Fairy|Tooth]], to arms. They are then told that Jack Frost has been chosen to be a new Guardian, and has him brought to the [[North Pole]] by Bunnymund. North explains to Jack that every Guardian has a centre - something they are the Guardian of, but a call for help from Tooth's fairies ends the conversation.

Visiting Tooth's world, Jack learns that each and every [[baby teeth|baby tooth]] contains childhood memories of the children who lost it, Jack's teeth included. However, Pitch raids Tooth's home, kidnapping all of her subordinate tooth fairies except Baby Tooth and stealing all the teeth, thus preventing Tooth from sharing Jack's memories and weakening children's belief in Tooth. In order to thwart Pitch's plan, the group decides to collect children's teeth. During their journey, a quarrel between North and Bunnymund awakens a boy, Jamie. Since he still believes, he can see everybody except for Jack. Pitch's nightmares then attack, provoking Sandy as the Guardian of Dreams. Jack tries to intervene, but Sandy is overwhelmed and killed by Pitch.

As Easter approaches, the dejected Guardians gather in Bunnymund's home. With the unexpected aid of Jamie's little sister, Sophie, they begin the process of painting eggs for Easter. After Jack takes Sophie home, he is lured to Pitch's lair by a voice. Pitch taunts him with his memories and fear of non-belief, distracting him long enough for Pitch to destroy the eggs, causing children to stop believing in Easter and Bunnymund. Losing his trust in the Guardians, a shamed Jack isolates himself in [[Antarctica]], where Pitch tries to convince him to join his side. When Jack refuses, Pitch threatens to kill Baby Tooth unless Jack gives him his staff, the source of his magic. He agrees, but Pitch breaks Jack's staff and throws him down a chasm. Unlocking his memories, he learns that he was a mortal teenager who fell into the frozen pond while saving his younger sister. Inspired, Jack repairs his staff and returns to the lair to rescue the kidnapped baby fairies.

Due to Pitch, every child in the world except Jamie disbelieves, drastically weakening the Guardians. Finding Jamie's belief wavering, Jack makes it snow in his room, renewing Jamie's belief and letting him see Jack. Jack and Jamie gather the boy's friends, whose renewed belief bolsters their fight against Pitch. Pitch threatens them, but their dreams prove stronger than his nightmares, resulting in Sandy's resurrection. Defeated and disbelieved in, Pitch tries to retreat, but his nightmares, sensing his own fears, turn on him and trap him in his lair. Afterward, Jamie and his friends bid goodbye to the Guardians as Jack accepts his place as the Guardian of Fun.

[[Roger Deakins]], the cinematographer who had already worked on the previous DreamWorks' film, ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'', advised on the lighting to achieve its real look. He selected photographic references for color keys, and during the production gave notes on contrast, saturation, depth of field and light intensity.<ref>{{cite news|last=Weintraub|first=Steve|title=Director Peter Ramsey Talks RISE OF THE GUARDIANS, Roger Deakins, HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON 2, Working with David Fincher on FIGHT CLUB, and More|url=http://collider.com/peter-ramsey-rise-of-the-guardians-how-train-your-dragon-2/212668/|accessdate=November 22, 2012|newspaper=Collider.com|date=November 20, 2012}}</ref> The film contains a lot of special effects, particularly the volumetric particles for depicting Sandman and Pitch.<ref>{{cite news|last=Orden|first=Erica|title=DreamWorks Releases Software Used in 'Guardians'|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323622904578129551861947218|accessdate=November 22, 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=November 20, 2012}}</ref> For this, DreamWorks Animation developed OpenVDB, a more efficient tool and format for manipulating and storing volume data, like smoke and other amorphous materials. OpenVDB had been already used on ''[[Puss in Boots (2011 film)|Puss in Boots]]'' and ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'', and was released in August 2012 for free as an open-source project with a hope to become an industry standard.<ref>{{cite news|title=DreamWorks Animation Releases Proprietary Volumetric Format OpenVDB to Open Source Community|url=http://ir.dreamworksanimation.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=698100|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130121175930/http://ir.dreamworksanimation.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=698100|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 21, 2013|accessdate=November 22, 2012|newspaper=DreamWorks Animation|date=August 3, 2012}}</ref>

Although the film is based on the Joyce's book series, it contains differences from the books. The book series, begun in 2011, explains the origins of the characters, while the film takes place about 300 years after the books, and shows how the characters function in present time. Joyce explained, "Because I don't want people to read the book and then go see the movie and go, 'Oh, I like the book better,' and I also didn't want them to know what happens in the movie. And I also knew that during the progress of film production, a lot of things can change. So I wanted to have a sort of distance, so we were able to invoke the books and use them to help us figure out the world of the movie, but I didn't want them to be openly competitive to each other."<ref name="A113Animation" /> The idea for the Guardians came from Joyce's daughter, who asked him "if he thought Santa Claus had ever met the Easter Bunny." The film includes a dedication to her,<ref name="THRAnalysis" /> as well a song, "Still Dream," sung over the end credits.<ref name=DeadlineAFI>{{cite news|last=Hammond|first=Pete|title=AFI Fest: 'Rise Of The Guardians' Tries To Stake Its Claim In Oscar Race And At Holiday Box Office|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/11/afi-fest-rise-of-the-guardians-oscar-boxoffice/|accessdate=November 6, 2012|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=November 5, 2012}}</ref>

Originally, the film was set to be released on November 2, 2012, but DreamWorks Animation pushed the film to November 21, 2012 to avoid competition with [[Pixar]]'s upcoming film ''[[Monsters University]]'', which in turn had been pushed to November 2, 2012 to avoid competition with ''[[The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn â€“ Part 2]]''.<ref name="BOM2">{{cite news |last=Subers |first=Ray |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2877 |title=Disney Shifts 'Monsters Inc. 2,' Drops Two Others | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | date=August 4, 2010 |accessdate=December 9, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006195001/http://boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2877|archivedate=October 6, 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> ''Monsters University'' was then pushed to June 21, 2013, with [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney's]] ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]'' taking its place.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/04/disney-changes-dates-for-reboot-ralph-monsters-university |title=Disney Changes Dates For 'Monsters University', 'Reboot Ralph' |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=April 4, 2011 |accessdate=July 10, 2011}}</ref>

Carrie Rickey of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars and found the film's characters to have "a primal familiarity, as though they were developed by a tag team of [[Maurice Sendak]] and [[Walt Disney]]."<ref>[http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/movies/reviews/20121121__Rise_of_the_Guardians___protecting_truth__justice_and_the_childhood_way.html 'Rise of the Guardians,' protecting truth, justice and the childhood way 'Rise of the Guardians,' protecting truth, justice and the childhood way] Retrieved February 17, 2013</ref> Olly Richards of ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' wrote, "It's gorgeously designed, deftly written and frequently laugh-out-loud funny.
