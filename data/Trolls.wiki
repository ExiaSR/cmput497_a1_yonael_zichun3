==Plot==   
<!-- Please see WP:FILMPLOT before editing. Per key guideline, the plot summary should be within the desired length of 400-700 words. -->
The Trolls are small creatures who live in an almost perpetual state of happiness, singing, dancing and hugging all day. However, they are discovered by the Bergens, large miserable creatures, who can feel happy only after eating a Troll. The Bergens imprison the trolls and eat them every year on a special occasion, called Trollstice. The Trolls, led by their king, King Peppy, with his baby daughter, Princess Poppy, escape through underground tunnels on the day of Trollstice, when Prince Gristle Jr. was going to eat his first Troll. Enraged, Gristle Jr.’s father King Gristle Sr. banishes Chef, who was in charge of preparing for Trollstice. Chef promises to leave and find the Trolls herself.

20 years later, Poppy throws a big party to celebrate the Trolls' escape, despite the fears and warnings of the over-cautious and egotistical gray troll, Branch, that loud parties will attract the Bergens. A Zen troll named Creek, who is Poppy's crush, arrives and tells Branch to start being happy instead of being grumpy; Branch refuses. At the party, Branch's fears come true, when Chef sees the fireworks and kidnaps Guy Diamond, Biggie with Mr. Dinkles, Fuzzbert, Smidge, Satin with Chenille, DJ Suki, Cooper, and Creek (which Poppy tried to rescue). Chef then takes the kidnapped Trolls back to Bergen Town, while secretly plotting to overthrow its monarchy in revenge for her banishment.

Alone inside the bunker, Branch looks at a bunch of homemade party invitations, indicating that he appreciates Poppy's offers of friendship and internally would like to have fun with the rest of the trolls. Meanwhile, Poppy goes on a rescue mission alone, as no other troll is willing to venture to Bergen Town, including Branch. But later on, when Poppy gets into trouble, she is saved by Branch, who thinks she will not make it if she goes alone. 
 
Once inside the Bergen king's castle, Poppy and Branch witness Creek get eaten by Gristle Jr. (who is now king), but Poppy remains hopeful that Creek survived. Poppy and Branch find the rest of the captured Trolls being guarded by a scullery maid named Bridget. Poppy discovers that Bridget is secretly in love with King Gristle Jr. and offers to help her get a date with the king while trying to confirm if Creek is alive.

While setting Bridget up for the date with a musical number, Branch refuses to sing and triggers an argument with Poppy, revealing that, as a child, his grandmother was captured and got killed while trying to save him, because his singing compromised his location to Chef. Branch's guilt and shame over his grandmother's death caused his color to turn from blue to gray.

After Poppy comforts him with a hug, Branch decides to help Bridget and the trolls, though he still refuses to sing. Bridget, disguised under the name of "Lady Glittersparkles" gets her date with Gristle Jr. at a roller rink and arcade restaurant and Gristle Jr. asks her to be his "plus one" at Trollstice. Poppy notices Creek being held captive inside the jewel adorning the king's mantle.

Having helped Bridget, the Trolls attempt to rescue Creek from Gristle's room and steal his jewel but discover that it is empty. The Trolls are then captured by Chef and are shocked to discover that Creek sold them out to the Bergens to spare himself from being eaten. Creek lures out every troll from Troll Village via cowbell and they are captured by Chef and the other Bergen cooks. With all the Trolls captured, thrown into a pot, and soon to be eaten, a heartbroken Poppy becomes sad after she had been betrayed by her crush, and loses hope as she and all the other Trolls turn gray.

Branch, even though he is gray, tries to sing "[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|True Colors]]" for Poppy to cheer her up, and also confesses his affection for her. Poppy, after regaining her colors, returns Branch's feelings, and they both end up restoring all the trolls' colors including Branch's. Bridget saves the trolls, willing to sacrifice herself. Poppy cannot bring herself to abandon Bridget after her sacrifice that is sure to doom her life, and with Branch and her friends, shows the Bergens that Bridget was Lady Glitter Sparkles and that it is not necessary to eat Trolls to be happy, and they too, can find happiness within themselves.

Chef refuses to accept the peace and tries to kill the Trolls, but is knocked into a serving cart that is sent rolling out of Bergen Town. Chef is set on fire with Creek, who was still in her pouch. Both species celebrate, bringing new life to the town and renewing the life of the troll tree. Poppy is then declared queen of the Trolls, and Poppy and Branch share a hug.

In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Chef and Creek's cart stops rolling. Chef prepares to eat Creek herself, but they soon find out they are on top of a monster, who opens his mouth and eats them both.

On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 75% based on 157 reviews; the [[average rating]] is 6.26/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''Trolls'' brings its instantly recognizable characters to the big screen in a colorful adventure that, while geared toward the younger set, isn't without rewards for parents."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/trolls/|title=Trolls (2016)|last=|first=|date=|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=May 23, 2019}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score of 56 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/trolls |title=Trolls Reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=November 10, 2016}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale,<ref name="CinemaScore">{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/CinemaScore/status/794759203126734848 |title=''Trolls'' |publisher=[[CinemaScore]] on Twitter |date=November 4, 2016 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2019}}</ref> while [[PostTrak]] reported filmgoers gave it an 80% overall positive score.<ref name="DeadlineWknd1"/>

Lindsey Bahr of [[Associated Press]] gave the film a positive review and said, "Ultimately, the 'get happy' moral of the story, while trite compared to something like ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'', is sufficiently sweet enough for its audience. Did you expect more from a piece of candy?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2016/11/02/review-trolls-is-big-hearted-sensory-overload|title=Review: 'Trolls' is big-hearted sensory overload|first1=Lindsey|last1=Bahr|first2=The Associated|last2=Press}}</ref> Bill Zwecker of ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and said, "You simply will walk out – or perhaps dance out – of the theater feeling very happy yourself."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/trolls-review/|title=Delightful 'Trolls' achieves maximum smiles per hour}}</ref> Andy Webster of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "Exuberant, busy and sometimes funny, DreamWorks Animation's ''Trolls'' is determined to amuse."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/movies/trolls-review.html|title=Review: The ‘Trolls’ Embark on a High-Haired Rescue Mission|date=November 3, 2016|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

She said, "Make no mistake: Kids are going to love this movie.
