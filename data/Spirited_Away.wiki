''Spirited Away'' tells the story of Chihiro Ogino (Hiiragi), a moody 10-year-old girl who, while moving to a new neighbourhood, enters the [[Kami|world of Kami (spirits)]] of Japanese [[Shinto]] folklore.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Shinto Perspectives in Miyazaki's Anime Film "Spirited Away''

==Plot==
<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES IN FILM ARTICLES SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->
Ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents are traveling to their new home when her father takes a shortcut, leading them to what appears to be an abandoned amusement park that Chihiro's father insists on exploring. They find a seemingly empty restaurant stall stocked with food, which Chihiro's parents immediately begin to eat. While exploring further, Chihiro finds an exquisite [[Sentō|bathhouse]] and meets a boy named Haku, who warns her to return across the riverbed before sunset. However, Chihiro discovers too late that her parents have metamorphosed into pigs, and she is unable to cross the now-flooded river.

Haku finds Chihiro and has her ask for a job from the bathhouse's boiler-man, Kamaji, a [[yōkai]] commanding the [[susuwatari]]. Kamaji refuses to hire her and asks worker Lin to send Chihiro to Yubaba, the witch who runs the bathhouse. Yubaba tries to frighten Chihiro away, but she persists, so Yubaba gives Chihiro a contract to work for her. Yubaba takes away her name and renames her {{nihongo|Sen|千}}. While visiting her parents' pigpen, Haku gives Sen a goodbye card she had with her, and Sen realizes that she had already forgotten her real name. Haku warns her that Yubaba controls people by taking their names, and that if she forgets hers like he has forgotten his, she will not be able to leave the spirit world.

Sen faces discrimination from the other workers because she is still a human and not a spirit; only Haku and Lin show sympathy for her. While working, she invites a silent creature named No-Face inside, believing him to be a customer. A "stink spirit" arrives as Sen's first customer, and she discovers he is the spirit of a polluted river. In gratitude for cleaning him, he gives Sen a magic [[vomiting#emetics|emetic]] [[dumpling]]. Meanwhile, No-Face imitates the gold left behind by the stink spirit and tempts a worker with gold, then swallows him. He demands food and begins [[gratuity|tipping]] extensively. He swallows two more workers when they interfere with his conversation with Sen.

Sen sees paper [[Shikigami]] attacking a [[Japanese dragon]] and recognizes the dragon as Haku metamorphosed. When a grievously injured Haku crashes into Yubaba's penthouse, Sen follows him upstairs. A shikigami that stowed away on her back shapeshifts into Zeniba, Yubaba's twin sister. She mutates Yubaba's son, Boh, into a mouse, creates a decoy Boh, and mutates Yubaba's [[harpy]] into a tiny, flylike bird. Zeniba tells Sen that Haku has stolen a magic golden [[Seal (East Asia)|seal]] from her, and warns Sen that it carries a deadly curse. Haku attacks the shikigami, which eliminates Zeniba's hologram. He falls into the boiler room with Sen, Boh, and the harpy on his back, where Sen feeds him part of the dumpling she had intended to give her parents, causing him to vomit both the seal and a black slug, which Sen crushes with her foot.

With Haku unconscious, Sen resolves to return the seal and apologize to Zeniba. Sen confronts No-Face, who is now massive, and feeds him the rest of the dumpling. No-Face follows Sen out of the bathhouse, steadily regurgitating everything he has eaten. Sen, No-Face, Boh, and the harpy travel to see Zeniba with train tickets given to her by Kamaji. Yubaba orders that Sen's parents be slaughtered, but Haku reveals that Boh is missing and offers to retrieve him if Yubaba releases Sen and her parents. Yubaba agrees, but only if Sen can pass a final test.

Sen, No-Face, Boh, and the harpy meet with Zeniba, who reveals that Sen's love for Haku broke her curse and that Yubaba used the black slug to control Haku. Haku appears at Zeniba's home in his dragon form and flies Sen, Boh, and the harpy to the bathhouse. No-Face decides to stay behind and become Zeniba's [[Spinning (textiles)|spinner]]. In mid-flight, Sen recalls falling years ago into the Kohaku River and being washed safely ashore, correctly guessing Haku's real identity as the spirit of the Kohaku River. When they arrive at the bathhouse, Yubaba forces Sen to identify her parents from among a group of pigs in order to break their curse. After Sen answers correctly, her contract combusts and she is given back her real name. Haku takes her to the now-dry riverbed and vows to meet her again. Chihiro crosses the riverbed to her restored parents, who do not remember anything. They walk back to their car, which is now covered in dust and leaves. Before getting in, Chihiro is shown to still be wearing the hairband No-Face spun for her at Zeniba's home.

Every summer, [[Hayao Miyazaki]] spent his vacation at a mountain cabin with his family and five girls who were friends of the family. The idea for ''Spirited Away'' came about when he wanted to make a film for these friends. Miyazaki had previously directed films for small children and teenagers such as ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'' and ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]'', but he had not created a film for 10-year-old girls. For inspiration, he read [[shōjo manga]] magazines like ''[[Nakayoshi]]'' and ''[[Ribon]]'' the girls had left at the cabin, but felt they only offered subjects on "crushes" and romance. When looking at his young friends, Miyazaki felt this was not what they "held dear in their hearts" and decided to produce the film about a young heroine whom they could look up to instead.<ref name="nausicaa">[http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/interviews/sen.html Miyazaki on Spirited Away // Interviews //] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425061730/http://nausicaa.net/miyazaki/interviews/sen.html |date=25 April 2017 }}.

Miyazaki had wanted to produce a new film for years, but his two previous proposals (one based on the Japanese book ''Kiri no Mukō no Fushigi na Machi'' ({{nihongo|霧のむこうのふしぎな町}}) by Sachiko Kashiwaba, and another about a teenage heroine) were rejected. Miyazaki's third proposal, which ended up becoming ''Sen and Chihiro's Spirited Away'', was more successful. The three stories revolved around a bathhouse that was inspired by one in Miyazaki's hometown. Miyazaki thought the bathhouse was a mysterious place, and there was a small door next to one of the bathtubs in the bathhouse. Miyazaki was always curious to what was behind it, and he made up several stories about it, one of which inspired the bathhouse setting of ''Spirited Away''.<ref name="nausicaa"/>

Production of ''Spirited Away'' commenced in 2000 on a budget of ¥1.9 billion ($15 million).<ref name="howe" /> Disney invested 10% of the cost for the [[right of first refusal]] for American distribution.<ref name="fps">{{cite web|url=http://www.fpsmagazine.com/comment/spirited.php|title=Spirited Away by Miyazaki|publisher=FPS Magazine|accessdate=11 August 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519193618/http://www.fpsmagazine.com/comment/spirited.php|archivedate=19 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As with ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'', Miyazaki and the [[Studio Ghibli]] staff experimented with computer animation. With the use of more computers and programs such as [[Softimage 3D]], the staff learned the software, but used the technology carefully so that it enhanced the story, instead of 'stealing the show'. Each character was mostly hand-drawn, with Miyazaki working alongside his animators to see they were getting it just right.<ref name="howe">[http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/michael_howe/archive/2003/04/15/1391.aspx The Making of Hayao Miyazaki's "Spirited Away"&nbsp;– Part 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312093531/http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/michael_howe/archive/2003/04/15/1391.aspx |date=12 March 2009 }}. Jimhillmedia.com.</ref> The biggest difficulty in making the film was to reduce its length. When production started, Miyazaki realized it would be more than three hours long if he made it according to his plot. He had to delete many scenes from the story, and tried to reduce the "eye candy" in the film because he wanted it to be simple. Miyazaki did not want to make the hero a "pretty girl." At the beginning, he was frustrated at how she looked "dull" and thought, "She isn't cute. Isn't there something we can do?" As the film neared the end, however, he was relieved to feel "she will be a charming woman."<ref name="nausicaa"/>

He often visited the museum for inspiration while working on the film. Miyazaki had always been interested in the Pseudo-Western style buildings from the [[Meiji period]] that were available there.

===English adaptation===
Under the supervision of [[Pixar]] animator [[John Lasseter]], a Miyazaki fan, Lasseter would sit with his staff and watch Miyazaki's work when encountering story problems, and at one point they did so with ''Spirited Away'', which impressed Lasseter.<ref name="howe3" /> Upon hearing his reaction to the film, people at Disney asked Lasseter if he would be interested in trying to bring ''Spirited Away'' to an American audience. Lasseter agreed to be the executive producer for the English adaptation. Soon, several others began to join the project: ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' co-director [[Kirk Wise]] and ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' co-producer [[Donald W. Ernst]] joined Lasseter as director and producer of ''Spirited Away'' respectively.<ref name="howe3">[http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/michael_howe/archive/2003/04/16/1393.aspx The Making of Hayao Miyazaki's "Spirited Away"&nbsp;– Part 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317040600/http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/michael_howe/archive/2003/04/16/1393.aspx |date=17 March 2009 }}. Jimhillmedia.com.</ref> Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt penned the English-language dialogue, which they wrote to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements.<ref name=latimes/>

The cast of the film consisted of [[Daveigh Chase]], [[Jason Marsden]], [[Susan Egan]], [[David Ogden Stiers]], and [[John Ratzenberger]] from Pixar. Advertising was limited, and ''Spirited Away'' was only mentioned in a small scrolling section of their film page on Disney's official website. Disney had sidelined their official website for ''Spirited Away'',<ref name="howe3" /> and given the film
a comparatively small promotional budget.<ref name=fps /> Marc Hairston argues that this was a justified response to Ghibli's retention of the merchandising rights to the film and characters, which limited Disney's ability to properly market the film.<ref name=fps />

==Themes==
The themes of the film are heavily influenced by Japanese Shinto-Buddhist folklore. The central location of the film is a Japanese bathhouse where a great variety of Japanese folklore creatures, including [[kami]], come to bathe. Miyazaki cites the solstice rituals when villagers call forth their local kami and invite them into their baths.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Chihiro also encounters kami of animals and plants. Miyazaki says of this: "In my grandparents' time, it was believed that kami existed everywhere – in trees, rivers, insects, wells, anything. My generation does not believe this, but I like the idea that we should all treasure everything because spirits might exist there, and we should treasure everything because there is a kind of life to everything."<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The film has been compared to [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' as the stories have some elements in common such as being set in a fantasy world, the plots including a disturbance in logic and stability, and there being motifs such as food having metamorphic qualities; though developments and themes are not shared.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/3975727|work=moviepilot.com|author=Sunny Bay|date=22 June 2016|title=Beyond Wonderland: 'Spirited Away' Explores The Significance Of Dreams In The Real World|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814000655/http://moviepilot.com/posts/3975727|archivedate=14 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=Spark>{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/film/spiritedaway/section5.rhtml|work=sparknotes.com|title="SparkNote on Spirited Away."

The major [[Theme (arts)|themes]] of ''Spirited Away'' center on the protagonist Chihiro and her [[Liminality|liminal]] journey through the realm of spirits. The [[archetype|archetypal]] entrance into another world demarcates Chihiro's status as one somewhere between child and adult. Chihiro also stands outside societal boundaries in the supernatural setting. The use of the word [[kamikakushi]] (literally "hidden by gods") within the Japanese title, and its associated folklore, reinforces this liminal passage: "Kamikakushi is a verdict of 'social death' in this world, and coming back to this world from Kamikakushi meant 'social resurrection.'"<ref name="reider">Reider, Noriko T. "Spirited Away: Film of the Fantastic and Evolving Japanese Folk Symbols." Film Criticism 29.3: 4–27. Academic OneFile. Gale. 11 February 2009.</ref>

Yubaba has many similarities to [[The Coachman]] from ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', in the sense that she mutates humans into pigs in a similar way that the boys of [[Pleasure Island (Pinocchio)|Pleasure Island]] were mutated into donkeys. Upon gaining employment at the bathhouse, Yubaba's seizure of Chihiro's [[true name]] symbolically kills the child,<ref name="satoshi3">Satoshi, Ando. "Regaining Continuity with the Past: Spirited Away and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." [[Bookbird]] 46.1: 23–29. Project MUSE. 11 February 2009 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/bookbird/v046/46.1.satoshi.pdf]{{subscription required}}.</ref> who must then assume adulthood. She then undergoes a [[rite of passage]] according to the [[monomyth]] format; to recover continuity with her past, Chihiro must create a new identity.<ref name="satoshi3" />

Along with its function within the ostensible [[coming of age]] theme, Yubaba's act of taking Chihiro's name and replacing it with Sen (an alternate reading of "chi", the first character in Chihiro's name – lit. "one thousand"), is symbolic of capitalism's single-minded concern with value, reflecting the film's exploration of capitalism and its effect on traditional Japanese culture.<ref name="napier">[[Susan J. Napier|Napier, Susan J.]] "Matter Out of Place: Carnival, Containment and Cultural Recovery in Miyazaki's Spirited Away." [[Journal of Japanese Studies]] 32.2: 287–310. Project MUSE. 11 February 2009 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_japanese_studies/v032/32.2napier.pdf].</ref>

Yubaba is stylistically unique within the bathhouse, wearing a Western dress and living among European décor and furnishings, in contrast with the minimalist Japanese style of her employee's quarters, representing the Western capitalist influence over Japan in its Meiji period and beyond. The Meiji design of the abandoned theme park is the setting for Chihiro's parents' metamorphosis - the family arrives in an imported Audi car and the father wears a European-styled polo shirt, reassuring Chihiro that he has "credit cards and cash", before their morphing into literal consumerist pigs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quia.com/files/quia/users/bakersensei/ext_japanese1.pdf|title=HSC Extension course|publisher=New South Wales Department of Education and Training|format=PDF|accessdate=7 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130074502/https://www.quia.com/files/quia/users/bakersensei/ext_japanese1.pdf|archivedate=30 January 2017|df=dmy-all}} {{unreliable source?|date=June 2016}}</ref>

''Spirited Away'' contains critical commentary on modern Japanese society concerning generational conflicts and environmental issues.<ref name="napier"/> Chihiro has been seen as a representation of the [[shōjo]], whose roles and ideology had changed dramatically since post-war Japan.<ref name="napier"/>

Miyazaki has stated:
{{Quote|Chihiro’s parents turning into pigs symbolizes how some humans become greedy. At the very moment Chihiro says there is something odd about this town, her parents turn into pigs. There were people that "turned into pigs" during Japan’s [[bubble economy]] ([[Consumerism#Consumerism as cultural ideology|consumer society]]) of the 1980s, and these people still haven’t realized they’ve become pigs. Once someone becomes a pig, they don’t return to being human but instead gradually start to have the "body and soul of a pig". These people are the ones saying, "We are in a recession and don’t have enough to eat." This doesn’t just apply to the fantasy world. Perhaps this isn’t a coincidence and the food is actually (an analogy for) "a trap to catch lost humans."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://en.rocketnews24.com/2016/07/14/studio-ghibli-letter-sheds-new-light-on-spirited-away-mysteries/ | title=Studio Ghibli letter sheds new light on Spirited Away mysteries | first=Corey | last=Gold | date=14 July 2016 | publisher=SoraNews24 | accessdate=24 April 2017 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307000504/http://en.rocketnews24.com/2016/07/14/studio-ghibli-letter-sheds-new-light-on-spirited-away-mysteries/ | archivedate=7 March 2017 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>}}

Just as Chihiro seeks her past identity, Japan, in its anxiety over the economic downturn occurring during the release of the film in 2001, sought to reconnect to past values.<ref name="satoshi3"/> In an interview, Miyazaki has commented on this nostalgic element for an old Japan.<ref name=midnight-eye>{{cite web|last=Mes|first=Tom|title=Hayao Miyazaki Interview|work=Midnight Eye|date=7 January 2002|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/interviews/hayao_miyazaki.shtml|accessdate=1 August 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802193550/http://www.midnighteye.com/interviews/hayao_miyazaki.shtml|archivedate=2 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

However, the bathhouse of the spirits cannot be seen as a place free of ambiguity and darkness.<ref name="thrupkaew">Thrupkaew, Noy. "Animation Sensation: Why Japan's Magical Spirited Away Plays Well Anywhere." [[American Prospect]] 13.19: 32–33. Academic OneFile. Gale. 11 February 2009.</ref> Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present;<ref name="napier"/> it is a place of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of the No-Face.<ref name="harris">Harris, Timothy. "Seized by the Gods." [[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]] 47.9: 64–67. Academic OneFile. Gale. 11 February 2009.</ref> In stark contrast to the simplicity of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constantly chaotic carnival in the background.<ref name="napier"/>

There are two major instances of allusions to environmental issues within the movie. The first is seen when Chihiro is dealing with the "stink spirit." The stink spirit was actually a river spirit, but it was so corrupted with filth that one couldn't tell what it was at first glance. It only became clean again when Chihiro pulled out a huge amount of trash, including car tires, garbage, and a bicycle. This alludes to human pollution of the environment, and how people can carelessly toss away things without thinking of the consequences and of where the trash will go. The second allusion is seen in Haku himself. Haku does not remember his name and lost his past, which is why he is stuck at the bathhouse. Eventually, Chihiro remembers that he used to be the spirit of the Kohaku River, which was destroyed and replaced with apartments. Because of humans' need for development, they destroyed a part of nature, causing Haku to lose his home and identity. This can be compared to deforestation and desertification; humans tear down nature, cause imbalance in the ecosystem, and demolish animals' homes to satisfy their want for more space (housing, malls, stores, etc.) but don't think about how it can affect other living things.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Saporito|first1=Jeff|title=What does "Spirited Away" say about Environmentalism?|url=http://screenprism.com/insights/article/what-does-spirited-away-say-about-environmentalism|website=ScreenPrism|accessdate=1 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303201035/http://screenprism.com/insights/article/what-does-spirited-away-say-about-environmentalism|archivedate=3 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Additional themes are expressed through the No-Face, who reflects the characters which surround him, learning by example and taking the traits of whomever he consumes. This nature results in No-Face's monstrous rampage through the bathhouse. After Chihiro saves No-Face with the emetic dumpling, he becomes timid once more. At the end of the film, Zeniba decides to take care of No-Face so he can develop without the negative influence of the bathhouse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web41.its.hawaii.edu/manoa.hawaii.edu/eastasia/wp/wp-content/uploads/2004/10/spiritedaway.pdf|title=Lesson Plan&nbsp;— Spirited Away|publisher=UHM|accessdate=12 August 2013|author=Gomes, Paul|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105170315/http://web41.its.hawaii.edu/manoa.hawaii.edu/eastasia/wp/wp-content/uploads/2004/10/spiritedaway.pdf|archivedate=5 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
