==Plot==
An ambitious young mother just moving to a new neighborhood and imposes a [[Coaching|life plan]] for her daughter that leaves no time for leisure, all for her to enroll in the prestigious Werth Academy. The girl, however, becomes distracted by her elderly retired aviator neighbor, who tells her the story of the "Little Prince", claiming that he encountered him in the [[Sahara]] after crash-landing there. The aviator recounts the Little Prince asking him to draw a sheep. He drew two sheep before the Little Prince complained he needed a sheep that would live forever. The aviator drew a box with three holes saying that the sheep was inside it, which satisfied the Little Prince.

The girl and the aviator continue to read and play together without the mother's knowledge. The aviator tells the girl about the Little Prince's home, "[[Asteroid]] B612", covered in [[Adansonia|baobab sprouts]]. He states that after clearing away the sprouts, the Little Prince found and nurtured a [[Rose]] into maturity. Despite becoming his friend, she was rather selfish, which caused the Little Prince to travel to elsewhere with a flock of birds. After meeting some adults on other asteroids, he eventually landed on Earth, meeting and taming a [[red fox]]. After a while, the fox bid goodbye to the Little Prince, advising him to always see with his heart. The aviator gives the girl a [[Stuffed toy|stuffed]] fox as a gift, telling her that he will leave soon to go find the Little Prince.

The two decide to go out for free "birthday" breakfast, but when they are pulled over by a police officer, the aviator is revealed to have no [[Driver's license|license]] and the officer returns the girl home. Realizing that she has not been following the plan, her mother redoubles her daughter's assignments. Nevertheless, the girl continues to read the story of the Little Prince, secretly visiting the aviator to find out the story's ending. The aviator tells her that the Little Prince had succumbed to a [[venomous snake]] bite in order to be reunited with his beloved Rose. Although the aviator assures the girl that he firmly believes the Little Prince succeeded, she is so upset by the dark twist to the story that she wishes she had never met the aviator or heard the story.

Towards the summer's end, the aviator is hospitalized. Knowing it was her mother's fault and wanting to put things right, the girl sets off in search of the Little Prince. Escaping out her bedroom window and climbing onto a downspout, the girl falls into the aviator's yard and blacks out. After she awakens, the girl, accompanied by her now-conscious stuffed fox (probably the reincarnation of the real one) and the Little Prince's story pages, flies the aviator's now-fixed plane into space. They find all the stars mysteriously gone, all the while landing on an asteroid populated by workaholic adults owned by the "Businessman" from the Little Prince's story, who captures and holds all the stars to power his asteroid and belongings. After encountering a police officer and an [[elevator operator]] – the "Conceited Man" and "the King" from the story – they finally find the Little Prince, who has become an adult named "Mr. Prince" and works as a janitor for the Businessman, having no recollection of his past.

Mr. Prince accordingly takes the girl to an "academy" where she is to be "reconditioned" as an adult by a machine controlled by a sinister Teacher. Recognizing the drawing of his sheep's box from the aviator's pages, which he still kept the original (due to his amnesia, he believed that it might be important), Mr. Prince begins to recover his memories and saves the girl from the same fate that he had by putting the Teacher in the machine instead, (which he was presumably "reconditioned" as an adult).

They escape together and liberate all of the stars from the Businessman's glass vault, which return to their rightful place in the sky. The girl and the fox then take Mr. Prince back to B612, which is overgrown with baobabs. They find the Rose dead, but seeing her image in the sunrise, the baobabs disappear and Mr. Prince turns back to his younger self, giving him renewed hope.

The girl and the fox return home, accompanied by another flock of birds. The next morning, the girl and her mother visit the aviator in the hospital. The girl apologizes and presents him the formerly loose pages bound together as a book, along with all the formerly missing parts filled in. The girl afterwards begins her studies at Werth Academy and reconciles with her mother. Both of them happily [[Amateur astronomy|stargaze]] one night, while the Little Prince and the aviator are heard laughing joyfully together on Asteroid B612.

===Development===
On 14 October 2010, ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'' co-director and ''[[More (1998 film)|More]]'' creator [[Mark Osborne (filmmaker)|Mark Osborne]] was hired and set to direct ''The Little Prince'' based on the 1943 [[The Little Prince|novel of the same name]]. Irena Brignull (writer of ''[[The Boxtrolls]]'') and [[Bob Persichetti]] wrote the script for the film based on a story conceived by Mark Osborne.<ref name="Production Notes">{{cite news|title=Press Kit: ''The Little Prince''|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/assets/Image/Direct/c7a1c29dbea30e0cfe0afcf2d9967baa.pdf|accessdate=22 January 2016|work=festival-cannes.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530123754/https://www.festival-cannes.com/assets/Image/Direct/c7a1c29dbea30e0cfe0afcf2d9967baa.pdf |archivedate=May 30, 2015 |deadurl=yes}}</ref> {{lang|fr|Aton Soumache}}, Alexis Vonarb and Dimitri Rassam produced the film with the budget of $70‒80 million for release in 2015.<ref name="THRinterview" />

The film features a framing device not present in the novel with a schoolgirl discovering ''The Little Prince'' through a reclusive elderly neighbour. Mark Osborne made the film's hero a little girl after research from the [[Geena Davis|Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media]] revealed the gender disparity among characters in animated films. She represents "the spirit of adulthood," according to Osborne.<ref name="LA Times">{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-sneaks-little-prince-20160110-story.html |title='The Little Prince's' latest journey full of bold, unexpected choices |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=8 January 2016 | accessdate=2 February 2016 }}</ref> "In animation, it always had to be boy-centric. Right now there seems to be a changing of the tide but these things don't happen overnight. These movies take years to make, so back when I was first pushing to make the little girl the main character, it was seen as quite revolutionary", Osborne recalled in April 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thedissolve.com/news/5433-hows-the-movie-industry-treating-women-this-week/ |title=How's the movie industry treating women this week? |website=[[The Dissolve]] | date=17 April 2015 | accessdate=2 February 2016 }}</ref>

Osborne was pitching the film to actors, artists, and distributors all over the world using what he called a "magic suitcase" full of hand-made [[Visual communication|visual aids]] specifically created to communicate the tone and passion for the project. Model maker Joe Schmidt (the modeller of ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'') created this suitcase, which held the art book, and told the story of the movie visually.<ref name="Production Notes"/> Schmidt had created a snapshot of Osborne's vision for the film. A constellation of tiny planets and stars lit up on one side, a giant art book of illustrations filled the other. From somewhere deep inside the case, Osborne pulled out two large white circles that held slides that when placed up to each eye displayed 3-D images of stop-motion puppets. Then Osborne started flipping switches. In no time, a one-way mirror slid away to reveal a hidden chamber holding a collection of yellowed pages below. It was a mock-up of Saint-Exupéry's original manuscript, a key plot point in Osborne's film.<ref name="LA Times"/> In four years, Osborne pitched the movie close to 400 times.<ref name="Production Notes"/>

===Casting===
On 5 June 2013, it was announced that [[James Franco]], [[Marion Cotillard]], [[Mackenzie Foy]], [[Benicio del Toro]], [[Paul Giamatti]], [[Rachel McAdams]] and [[Jeff Bridges]] joined the film.<ref>{{cite news |title=James Franco, Rachel McAdams, Jeff Bridges Among Voice Stars for ''The Little Prince'' |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/james-franco-rachel-mcadams-jeff-563612 |accessdate=15 September 2013 |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=5 June 2013 }}</ref> [[Albert Brooks]] joined the cast on 12 September to voice The Businessman, a villain.<ref>{{cite news |title=Albert Brooks lends voice to ''The Little Prince'' |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/09/albert-brooks-lends-voice-to-the-little-prince |accessdate=15 September 2013 |newspaper=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=12 September 2013 }}</ref>

Thanks to Osborne's emotionally engaging pitch and the global popularity of Saint-Exupéry's book, a group of A-list actors were able to be recruited to lend their voices to the film's characters. As Osborne explained, "It began with [[Jeff Bridges]]. He was our first and only choice to play the Aviator, so after a great deal of time trying to get to him, I finally got the chance to go to his home in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] to talk to him directly. He was blown away by the pitch, and it really put us on the road to assembling the perfect cast." As Bridges recalls, he was instantly drawn to the role of the Aviator. "Mark gave me this incredible pitch, brought this suitcase with him which showed me what the movie was going to be about. We shared the same concern, which was if you simply just move around these iconic characters like the book, it might not do justice to the work. He had this great other story, which treated the book as almost another character in the movie. It’s a great way to pay tribute to this classic book, so I was excited and thrilled to be part of it."<ref name="Production Notes"/>

In the early stages of production, Mark Osborne's daughter Maddie and his son Riley, helped by providing the temporary scratch voices for the roles of the Little Girl and the Little Prince. His daughter got older and her voice began to change, so she had to be replaced by the 12-year-old [[Mackenzie Foy]]. Osborne's son Riley was kept as the voice of The Little Prince because they never found anyone who did a better job than him. "He was 11 at the time, and was very  natural in the part so we kept him as the Prince!", Osborne told.<ref name="Production Notes"/>
  
To voice the complex role of the Little Girl's Mother, the film-makers approached [[Rachel McAdams]]. ''The Little Prince'' marks the first time McAdams has lent her voice to an animated  project. "I was so excited to be part of this movie, and I loved ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'', so I knew our director Mark (Osborne) was going to do a wonderful job with the adaptation. I couldn’t have asked for a better introduction to animation." McAdams says it was important for her to connect with the material. "I play the Little Girl's Mother, who is a working single mum. She has this massive, intricate life-plan for her daughter and wants her to follow the rules to a tee. The Mother is a little highly-strung, but she means well. She and her daughter are a real team until the Little Girl drifts away."<ref name="Production Notes"/>

===Music===
The film's score was composed by [[Hans Zimmer]] and [[Richard Harvey]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2014/12/10/hans-zimmer-to-score-the-little-prince |title=Hans Zimmer to score ''The Little Prince'' |work=Film Music Reporter |date=10 December 2014 |accessdate=10 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/movie/the-little-prince-2015 |title=''The Little Prince'' Movie Information |work=soundtrack.net |accessdate=17 August 2015 }}</ref> [[Camille (singer)|Camille]] was featured in the film's soundtrack.
