'''''Ratatouille''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|r|æ|t|ə|ˈ|t|uː|i}} {{respell|RAT|ə|TOO|ee}}, {{IPA-fr|ʁatatuj|lang}}) is a 2007 American [[computer-animated]] [[comedy film]] produced by [[Pixar]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. It is the eighth film produced by Pixar and was co-written and directed by [[Brad Bird]], who took over from [[Jan Pinkava]] in 2005. The title refers to a French dish, [[ratatouille]], which is served at the end of the film and is also a play on words about the species of the main character. The plot follows a [[rat]] named Remy, who dreams of becoming a chef and tries to achieve his goal by forming an alliance with a Parisian restaurant's garbage boy.

The film stars the voices of [[Patton Oswalt]] as Remy, an anthropomorphic [[rat]] who is interested in cooking; [[Lou Romano]] as Alfredo Linguini, a young garbage boy who befriends Remy; [[Ian Holm]] as Skinner, the head chef of Auguste Gusteau's restaurant; [[Janeane Garofalo]] as Colette, a [[rôtisseur]] at Gusteau's restaurant; [[Peter O'Toole]] as Anton Ego, a restaurant critic; [[Brian Dennehy]] as Django, Remy's father and leader of his clan; [[Peter Sohn]] as Emile, Remy's older brother; and [[Brad Garrett]] as Auguste Gusteau, a recently deceased chef.

Development of ''Ratatouille'' began in 2000 when Pinkava wrote the original concepts of the film. In 2005, Bird was approached to direct the film and revise the story. Bird and some of the film's crew members also visited Paris for inspiration. To create the food animation used in the film, the crew consulted chefs from both France and the United States. Bird also interned at [[Thomas Keller]]'s [[The French Laundry]] restaurant, where Keller developed the [[confit byaldi]], a dish used in the film.

''Ratatouille'' premiered on June 22, 2007, at the [[Dolby Theatre|Kodak Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], with its general release June 29, 2007, in the United States. The film grossed $620.7&nbsp;million at the box office and received critical acclaim. The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] and was later voted one of the 100 greatest motion pictures of the 21st century by a [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century|2016 poll of international critics]] conducted by the [[BBC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |title=The 21st Century's 100 greatest films |publisher=BBC |date=August 23, 2016 |accessdate=December 16, 2016}}</ref>

==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->
Remy is an idealistic and ambitious young rat with highly developed senses of taste and smell who dreams of becoming a chef like his idol, the famous Auguste Gusteau, who passed away two years before 1961; his brother Emile and the other rats only seek out food for sustenance. One day when his family is forced to flee their home, Remy becomes separated from the pack and eventually finds himself at a skylight overlooking the kitchen of Gusteau's Restaurant in Paris.

He sees a young garbage boy Alfredo Linguini spill a pot of soup and attempt to recreate it. Remy sees that Linguini is actually ruining the soup and fixes his mistakes, which Linguini witnesses. However, Skinner, Gusteau's former [[sous-chef]] and new owner, confronts Linguini for tampering with the soup, but while they argue the soup is accidentally served and proves to be a success. Colette Tatou, the staff's only female chef, convinces Skinner to retain Linguini, who is assumed to be the soup's creator. When Skinner catches Remy trying to escape, he orders Linguini to kill the rat, but Linguini discovers Remy's intelligence and decides to keep him instead. On Linguini's first day as a chef, he and Remy find a way to communicate: Linguini hides Remy under his [[toque]] where Remy guides Linguini like a [[marionette]] by pulling on his hair. Skinner assigns Colette to train his new cook.

Skinner and Remy learn that Linguini is actually Gusteau's  son and the rightful owner of the restaurant. Remy gives the evidence to Linguini, forcing Skinner to step down as owner. The restaurant thrives, Remy's recipes become popular, and a romance develops between Linguini and Colette, causing Remy to feel left out. He visits Emile and his clan in their new home, but Remy and his father Django fall out over his admiration for humans and Remy leaves.

Meanwhile, the dour world-renowned food critic Anton Ego, whose negative review precipitated Gusteau's death, announces he will dine at the restaurant. After getting into a heated argument with Linguini, Remy leads his clan to raid the restaurant's pantries in revenge, but Linguini drives them out. Remy is captured by Skinner, who intends to use Remy's talents to create a line of frozen food products, but is promptly freed by Django and Emile. Linguini apologizes to Remy, having been unable to cook without him, and reveals the truth to the staff, who leaves in disgust. Colette returns after recalling Gusteau's motto, "Anyone can cook."

Impressed by Remy's determination, Django and the clan offer to help. The rats cook while Linguini waits tables. Remy creates a ratatouille variation, [[confit byaldi]], which reminds Ego of his mother's cooking. The rats tie up Skinner and a health inspector to prevent them revealing that rats are cooking, and when Ego requests to see the chef, Linguini and Colette make him wait until the other diners have left before introducing Remy. Ego is stunned and writes a glowing review, saying he now truly understands Gusteau's famous motto and calling Remy "nothing less than the finest chef in France."

However, the restaurant is eventually closed due to the presence of rats violating health regulations, causing Ego to lose his job and his credibility as a critic. He then funds and frequents a popular new bistro, La Ratatouille, created and run by Remy, Linguini, and Colette, and the rats settle into their new home on the bistro's roof.

[[Brad Bird]] reteamed with [[Michael Giacchino]] on the score for ''Ratatouille'' since they got along well during the scoring of ''[[The Incredibles]]''. Giacchino had written two themes for Remy, one about his thief self and the other about his hopes and dreams. He also wrote a buddy theme for both Remy and Linguini that plays when they're together. In addition to the score, Giacchino wrote the main theme song, "Le Festin", about Remy and his wishes to be a chef. [[Camille (singer)|Camille]] was hired to perform "Le Festin" after Giacchino listened to her music and realized she was perfect for the song; as a result, the song is sung in French in all versions of the film.<ref name="slashfilm1">{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/michael-giacchino-talks-music-pixar-d23-expo/ |title=Michael Giacchino Talks The Music Of Pixar [D23 Expo&#93; &#124; /Film |publisher=Slashfilm.com |date=September 2, 2011 |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref>

The music for ''Ratatouille'' gave Giacchino his first [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] as well as his first [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media|Best Score Soundtrack Album]]. Giacchino returned to Pixar to score their 2009 blockbuster ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]''.<ref name="slashfilm1"/>

==Release==

''Ratatouille'' was originally going to be released in 2006; however, in December 2004, the date was changed to 2007. This happened because [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] changed the release date of ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', from November 2005 to June 2006, thus pushing ''Ratatouille'' to 2007.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4078711.stm  |title=Pixar-Disney delay Cars release |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=December 8, 2004}}</ref>

===Marketing===
The trailer for ''Ratatouille'' debuted with the release of its immediate predecessor, ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]''. It depicts an original scene where Remy is caught on the cheese trolley in the restaurant's dining area sampling the cheese and barely escaping the establishment, intercut with separate scenes of the rat explaining directly to the audience why he is taking such risks. Similar to most of Pixar's teaser trailers, the scene was not present in the final film release.<ref name="yahoo1">{{cite web |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/video/ratatouille-trailer-185316448.html |title='Ratatouille' Theatrical Trailer |publisher=Yahoo! |date=April 15, 2013 |accessdate=October 5, 2013}}</ref>

[[Image:Ratatouille-wine.jpg|right|thumb|The front label of the planned ''Ratatouille'' wine to have been promoted by Disney, Pixar, and Costco, and subsequently pulled for its use of a cartoon character]]
Disney and Pixar were working to bring a French-produced ''Ratatouille''-branded wine to [[Costco]] stores in August 2007, but abandoned plans because of complaints from the California [[Wine Institute (California)|Wine Institute]], citing standards in labeling that restrict the use of cartoon characters to avoid attracting under-age drinkers.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/la-fi-ratwine28jul28,0,7091322.story?coll=la-home-center | title=Disney backs out of wine promotion |last=Lifster |first=Marc |date=July 28, 2007 |accessdate =August 1, 2007 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>

In the United Kingdom, in place of releasing a theatrical trailer, a theatrical commercial featuring Remy and Emile was released in cinemas before its release to discourage obtaining unlicensed copies of films.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bvimovies.com/spotlight/anti_piracy.html |title=RATATOUILLE'S Remy fights movie piracy |publisher=The Film Factory |accessdate=December 23, 2007}}</ref> Also in the United Kingdom, the main characters were used for a theatrical commercial for the [[Nissan Note]], with Remy and Emile watching an original commercial for it made for the "Surprisingly Spacious" ad campaign and also parodying it, respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visit4info.com/details.cfm?adid=49783 |title=Nissan Note Exploding Cars It's Possible |publisher=Visit4Info |accessdate=December 23, 2007}}</ref>

Disney/Pixar was concerned that audiences, particularly children, would not be familiar with the word "ratatouille" and its pronunciation. The title was therefore also spelled phonetically within trailers and on posters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://deepfocusreview.com/Reviews/ratatouille.asp |title=''Ratatouille'' review |last=Eggert |first=Brian | date=June 29, 2007 |accessdate=October 15, 2007 |publisher=DeepFocusReview.com}}</ref> For similar reasons, in the American release of the film, on-screen text in French was printed in English, such as the title of Gusteau's cookbook and the sign telling kitchen staff to wash their hands, though in the British English release, these are rendered in French. In Canada, the film was released theatrically with text in English, but on DVD, the majority of the text (including Gusteau's will) was in French.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117967050.html?categoryid=2520&cs=1 | title=Pixar hopes auds find 'Ratatouille' tasty |last=Graser |first=Marc |date=June 15, 2007 |accessdate=October 15, 2007 |work=Variety }}</ref>

The disc also includes a CG short entitled ''[[Lifted (2006 film)|Lifted]]'', which screened before the film during its theatrical run. It depicts an adolescent [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] attempting to abduct a sleeping human. Throughout the sequence, he is graded by an adult extraterrestrial in a manner reminiscent of a [[driver's license|driver's licensing]] exam road test. The entire short contains no dialogue, which is typical of Pixar Shorts not based on existing properties.<ref name="pixarplanet1">{{cite web |url=http://pixarplanet.com/blog/first-lifted-review |title=First Lifted Review&nbsp;— Upcoming Pixar |publisher=Pixarplanet.com |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref> Also included among the special features are deleted scenes, a featurette featuring Brad Bird discussing filmmaking and chef [[Thomas Keller]] discussing culinary creativity entitled "Fine Food and Film", and four [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]].
