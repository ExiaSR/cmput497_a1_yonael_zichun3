==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for films should be no longer than 700 words. -->
In [[Medieval Scotland]], Princess Merida of the clan Dunbroch is given a bow and arrow by her father, King Fergus, for her sixth birthday to the dismay of her mother, Queen Elinor. While venturing into the woods to fetch a stray arrow, Merida encounters a [[will-o'-the-wisp]]. Soon afterward, Mor'du, a huge demon bear, attacks the family. Merida flees on horseback with Elinor, while Fergus and his men fend off Mor'du, though the fight costs him one of his legs.

Ten years later, Merida has 3 little brothers: red-headed triplets who get away with everything, while she gets away with nothing. She is told that she is to be betrothed to the son of one of her father's allies. Elinor explains that failure to consent to the betrothal could harm Dunbroch, reminding Merida of a legend of a prince whose pride and refusal to follow his father's wishes destroyed his kingdom.

The allied clan chieftains and their first-born sons arrive to compete in the [[Highland games]] for Merida's hand in marriage. Merida twists the rules, announcing that as her own clan's firstborn she is eligible to compete for her own hand. She easily bests her suitors in an archery contest, shaming the other clans, and after a heated argument with Elinor, runs away into the forest. Wisps appear, leading her to the hut of an elderly witch. Merida bargains for a spell to change her fate, and the witch gives her an enchanted cake.

When Merida gives Elinor the cake, it transforms her into a bear, unable to speak but still retaining most of her human consciousness. Merida returns to the witch's cottage with Elinor, only to find it deserted, and discovers a message from the witch: unless Merida is able to "mend the bond torn by pride" before the second sunrise, the spell will become permanent. Merida and Elinor are led by the wisps to ancient ruins, where they encounter Mor'du. Realizing that Mor'du was the prince in the legend, Merida vows that she will not let the same thing happen to her mother, and concludes she needs to repair the family tapestry she damaged during their argument.

They return to the castle to find the clans on the verge of war. Merida intends to relent and declare herself ready to choose a suitor as tradition demands, but Elinor prompts her instead to insist that the firstborns should be allowed to marry in their own time to whomever they choose. The clans agree, breaking tradition but renewing and strengthening their alliance.

Merida sneaks into the tapestry room with Elinor. Elinor, who is losing her humanity, attacks Fergus, but suddenly regains her composure and flees the castle. Mistaking the queen for Mor'du and unwilling to listen to Merida, Fergus pursues the bear with the other clans, locking Merida in the castle. Merida escapes with the assistance of her brothers, who have also eaten the enchanted cake. They are now bear cubs. Merida repairs the tapestry and rides out after her father. Fergus and the clans capture Elinor, but Merida intervenes and stops her father before Mor'du arrives. Mor'du batters the clan warriors and targets Merida, but Elinor intercedes, holding off Mor'du and causing him to be crushed by a falling [[menhir]]. This releases the [[spirit]] of the prince, who silently thanks Merida for freeing him. Merida covers her mother in the repaired tapestry, but she remains a bear. As the sun rises for the second time, Merida realizes the mistakes she has made and reconciles with Elinor, unknowingly fulfilling the true meaning of the witch's message and reversing the spell's effects.

With Mor'du gone, Merida and Elinor work together on a new tapestry when they are called to the docks to bid farewell to the other clans, and ride their horses.

===Casting===

===Music===
{{Main|Brave (soundtrack)}}
The score for ''Brave'' was composed by [[Patrick Doyle]] and performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. The orchestra was conducted by [[James Shearman]]. To bring some of Scotland's native flavor to the music, Doyle used traditional Celtic instruments such as [[bagpipes]], a solo [[fiddle]], [[Clàrsach|Celtic harps]], flutes and the [[bodhrán]], with an electronically treated [[Hammered dulcimer|dulcimer]] and [[cimbalom]] to give it a more contemporary feel.  "I employed many classic Scottish dance rhythms such as [[Reel (dance)|reels]], [[jig]]s, and [[Strathspey (dance)|strathspeys]], which not only serve the action but keep it authentic," said Doyle.<ref name="Soundtrack">{{cite press release|title=Sounds Of The Highlands; Disney-Pixar's "Brave" Transports Moviegoers to Ancient Scotland with Oscar-Nominated Composer Patrick Doyle, Plus Performers Julie Fowlis and Birdy (with Mumford & Sons)|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sounds-of-the-highlands-disney-pixars-brave-transports-moviegoers-to-ancient-scotland-with-oscar-nominated-composer-patrick-doyle-plus-performers-julie-fowlis-and-birdy-with-mumford--sons-152256415.html|accessdate=May 22, 2012|publisher=Walt Disney Records|date=May 21, 2012}}</ref> As part of his research, he spent time in the Hebrides studying "unaccompanied [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] [[Hymnbooks of the Church of Scotland#Scots Metrical Psalter .281650.29|psalm singing]]."<ref>{{cite news|last=Cornwell|first=Tim|title=Scotland's Pixar tale hits the right note|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/Scotland39s-Pixar-tale-hits-the.6793996.jp?articlepage=1|accessdate=September 6, 2011|newspaper=[[The Scotsman]]|date=July 1, 2011}}</ref>

Doyle also composed several songs for the film. The lullaby duet between characters Princess Merida and Queen Elinor entitled "A Mhaighdean Uasal Bhan (Noble Maiden Fair)" appears on three occasions in different variations within the fabric of the score, and uniquely includes Gaelic vocals by Emma Thompson and Peigi Barker, the first Disney film with music featuring the language.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The drinking song "Song of Mor'du" (lyrics by Doyle and Steve Purcell) sung by [[Billy Connolly]], Scott Davies, [[Patrick Doyle]], Gordon Neville, [[Alex Norton]] and Carey Wilson, features a rich variety of words, sung authentically in [[Scots (language)|Scots]], which is distinct from Scottish Gaelic. (Scots being a Germanic language, while Scottish Gaelic is Celtic.)

In addition to Doyle's music, the film features three other original songs; "Learn Me Right" written by [[Mumford & Sons]] and performed with [[Birdy (singer)|Birdy]], "Touch the Sky" (music by Alex Mandel, lyrics by Mark Andrews & Mandel) and "Into the Open Air" (music and lyrics by Alex Mandel). Both "Touch the Sky" and "Into the Open Air" were performed by [[Julie Fowlis]], as Merida's off-screen musical thoughts. These two tracks were produced by composer and arranger Jim Sutherland, who is also featured as a performer.

Along with introducing Doyle to a number of specialist Celtic musicians who feature in the score, Sutherland was responsible for discovering the young Gaelic singer Peigi Barker; the voice of Young Merida.

[[Walt Disney Records]] released the soundtrack on both CD album and digital download on June 19, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amazon.com: Brave: Various Artists, Patrick Doyle, James Shearman: Music|url=https://www.amazon.com/Brave-Various-Artists/dp/B007XSFKAW| publisher = [[Amazon.com]] |accessdate = July 6, 2012}}</ref>

===Tartans===
[[File:DunBroch tartan.jpg|thumb|Clan DunBroch tartan, [[Scottish Tartans Authority|STA]] 10641]]

Pixar created three original [[tartan]] patterns for the film for three of the four clans – DunBroch, Dingwall, and MacGuffin. (Clan Macintosh wears a red tartan similar to the nonfictional [[Clan Mackintosh]].)

[[The Walt Disney Company]] registered the Clan DunBroch tartan with the official [[Scottish Register of Tartans]] upon release of the film. The tartan consists of ocean blue for the [[North Sea]], subdued scarlet for bloodshed during the clan wars, deep green for the [[Scottish Highlands]], navy blue for the eventual unity of the four clans, and gray for the Scottish people. In selecting the color scheme, Pixar took historical considerations, stating that "[t]here was a concerted effort to use hues that were indicative of the less saturated dyeing techniques [used] during the [[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages|ancient period]] in which the fantasy film is set."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tartanregister.gov.uk/tartanDetails.aspx?ref=10641|title=Tartan Details - The Scottish Register of Tartans|first=National Records of|last=Scotland|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}</ref>

The registration was celebrated at the film's British premiere in [[Edinburgh]], where Scottish First Minister [[Alex Salmond]] presented a certificate to director Mark Andrews. However, Member of the Scottish Parliament [[Alex Johnstone]] criticized the registration (as well as other fiction-based entries such as one for [[Peter Rabbit]]) as "shallow and irreverent." Mr. Johnstone contended that the 2008 legislation that created The Scottish Register of Tartans was intended to prevent such entries and protect Scotland's heritage.<ref>"[http://www.deadlinenews.co.uk/2013/01/03/scottish-register-of-tartans-criticised-over-approving-disney-designs/ Scottish Register of Tartans criticized after approving Disney designs]". ''Deadline.''. January 3, 2013.</ref>

===Box office===
''Brave'' earned $237.3 million in North America, and $303.2 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $540.4 million.<ref name="box-mojo" /> It was the 13th highest-grossing film of 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=2012&p=.htm|title=2012 Yearly Box Office Results - Box Office Mojo|work=boxofficemojo.com|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}</ref> the eighth highest-grossing Pixar film,<ref name="Pixar">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=pixar.htm|title=Pixar|work=boxofficemojo.com|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}</ref> and the third highest-grossing animated film that year behind ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' ($875.3 million) and ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' ($746.9 million).

In North America, pre-release tracking suggested the film would open between $55&nbsp;million to $65&nbsp;million in North America,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/brave-abraham-lincoln-vampire-hunter-box-office-340776|title=Box Office Preview: 'Brave' to Slay 'Abraham Lincoln' With About $60 Million|first=Pamela|last=McClintock|date=June 21, 2012|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=June 22, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/22/business/la-fi-ct-projector-20120622|title='Brave' expected to easily defeat 'Abraham Lincoln' at box office|first=Amy|last=Kaufman|date=June 22, 2012|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}</ref> which is slightly below average for a Pixar film,<ref name="BOM-forecast" /> as trackers initially suggested that as a "princess story", the film might not appeal as much to male audiences.<ref name="BOM-forecast" />

It opened on June 22, 2012, with $24.6&nbsp;million and finished its opening weekend with $66.3&nbsp;million (the same amount as ''Cars 2'', Pixar's previous film), at the upper end of the numbers analysts predicted.<ref>[http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=daily&id=bearandthebow.htm "Brave (2012){{spaced ndash}} Daily Box Office Results"].

===Critical response===
''Brave'' received a 78% approval rating on the review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on reviews from 244 critics, with an average rating of 7/10. The site's critical consensus reads: "''Brave'' offers young audiences and fairy tale fans a rousing, funny fantasy adventure with a distaff twist and surprising depth."<ref name="RotTotBrave">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/brave_2012/|title=Brave (2012)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=August 2, 2019}}</ref> Another review aggregator, [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Normalization (statistics)|normalized]] rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 69 based on 37 reviews, or "generally favorable".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/brave|title=Brave Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=July 3, 2012}}</ref> The film was well-received among American audiences, earning an "A", according to [[CinemaScore]].<ref name="wrap-weekend" />

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. He wrote, "The good news is that the kids will probably love it, and the bad news is that parents will be disappointed if they're hoping for another Pixar groundbreaker. Unlike such brightly original films as ''[[Toy Story]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'', and ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'', this one finds Pixar poaching on traditional territory of Disney." He said that the film did have an uplifting message about improving communication between mothers and daughters, "although transforming your mother into a bear is a rather extreme first step".<ref>{{cite news|title=Brave|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120620/REVIEWS/120629997|accessdate=June 21, 2012|author=Roger Ebert|authorlink=Roger Ebert|date=June 20, 2012|work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Peter Debruge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave a positive review of the film,  writing that the film "offers a tougher, more self-reliant heroine for an era in which princes aren't so charming, set in a sumptuously detailed Scottish environment, where her spirit blazes bright as her fiery red hair".  Debruge said that "adding a female director, [[Brenda Chapman]], to its creative boys' club, the studio [[Pixar]] has fashioned a resonant tribute to mother-daughter relationships that packs a level of poignancy on par with such beloved male-bonding classics as ''Finding Nemo''".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117947728 |title=Brave|last=Debruge|first=Peter|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=June 11, 2012|date=June 10, 2012}}</ref>

Conversely, [[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave it a negative review, stating that the film "diminishes into a rather wee thing as it chugs along, with climactic drama that is both too conveniently wrapped up and hinges on magical elements that are somewhat confusing to boot".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/brave-review-disney-pixar-335633|title=Brave: Film Review|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=June 10, 2012|accessdate=June 11, 2012 | authorlink = Todd McCarthy }}</ref> [[Leonard Maltin]] on ''[[IndieWire]]'' said, "I'll give it points for originality, but that story twist is so bizarre that it knocked me for a loop. The movie tries to make up for this detour with a heart-tugging, emotional finale, but the buildup to that moment has been undermined, so it doesn’t have the impact it should."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://blogs.indiewire.com/leonardmaltin/bravemovie-review |author= Maltin, Leonard |authorlink= Leonard Maltin |date= June 2012 |title= ''Brave—movie review'' |publisher= [[IndieWire]] |accessdate= May 26, 2013}}</ref>

Some reviewers saw the Merida character as a novel break from the traditional line of [[Disney Princess|Disney princesses]].  There were some dissonance and criticism among viewers and organized feminists when her character was scheduled to be "crowned" a Disney princess, only for artists to render her thinner, with less frizzy hair, and rounder eyes, more like the other princesses from previous Disney movies. This inspired girl-empowerment website A Mighty Girl to file a petition that Disney not alter their character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amightygirl.com/blog/?p=3253|title=Say No to the Merida Makeover and Keep Our Hero Brave!|publisher=A Mighty Girl|accessdate=May 13, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=June|first=Daniel|title="Brave’s" Merida Gets a Makeover, Upsetting Feminists and Others|url=http://www.jdjournal.com/2013/05/10/braves-merida-gets-a-makeover-upsetting-feminists-and-others/|accessdate=May 12, 2013|newspaper=JD Journal|date=May 10, 2013}}</ref> One of the 262,196 signatories was Brenda Chapman, the director of the film, who felt that Disney had "betrayed the essence of what we were trying to do with Merida&nbsp;— give young girls and women a better, stronger role model",<ref>{{cite news|last=Melissa|first=Silverstein|title=Brave Director Brenda Chapman Responds to Merida Coronation|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/womenandhollywood/brave-director-brenda-chapman-responds-to-merida-coronation#|accessdate=May 14, 2013|newspaper=IndieWire|date=May 13, 2013}}</ref> and that the makeover was "a blatantly sexist marketing move based on money".<ref>{{cite news|last=Liberatore|first=Paul|title='Brave' creator blasts Disney for 'blatant sexism' in princess makeover|url=http://www.marinij.com/millvalley/ci_23224741/brave-creator-blasts-disney-blatant-sexism-princess-makeover|accessdate=May 14, 2013|newspaper=Marin Independent Journal|date=May 11, 2013}}</ref> The online petition was considered a success, as shortly after it appeared Disney removed the redesigned image from their official website, in favor of Merida's original film appearance.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Disney-Pulls-Merida-Makeover-Outcry-37551.html|title = CinemaBlend.com|last = |first = |date = May 15, 2013|work = Disney Pulls Merida's Makeover After Outcry|accessdate = September 12, 2013}}</ref> Disney later clarified the situation, assuring that Merida would remain in her original form.<ref>[http://www.insidethemagic.net/2013/05/exclusive-disney-bravely-responds-to-merida-makeover-outrage-says-2d-new-look-was-for-limited-use-only/ Exclusive: Disney bravely responds to Merida makeover outrage, says 2D new look was for "limited" use only] Retrieved May 24, 2013</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bahr |first=Lindsey |url=http://family-room.ew.com/2013/05/15/brave-merida-makeover/ |title='Brave': Merida remains the girl you know and love - EXCLUSIVE &#124; The Family Room &#124; EW.com |publisher=Family-room.ew.com |date=May 15, 2013 |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}</ref>

==Possible sequel==
Scottish publication ''[[The Scotsman]]'' asked director Mark Andrews about the possibility of a sequel. Andrews said: 
{{Quote|I don't know if there will be another one. We never make a film at Pixar to have a sequel. It is always nice when you do and we kind of have a philosophy that if we find the right story then we will. Surely the marketing and success of ''Brave'' says that you can have one and they will come.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ferguson|first=Brian|title=Sequel to Disney-Pixar's Brave on the cards|url=http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/scotland/sequel-to-disney-pixar-s-brave-on-the-cards-1-2885742|accessdate=April 28, 2013|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=April 10, 2013}}</ref>}}
