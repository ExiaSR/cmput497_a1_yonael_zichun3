'''''How to Train Your Dragon''''' is a 2010 American [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] [[Action film|action]] [[fantasy film]] loosely based on the [[How to Train Your Dragon#How to Train Your Dragon (2003)|2003 book of the same name]] by British author [[Cressida Cowell]], produced by [[DreamWorks Animation]] and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film was directed by [[Chris Sanders]] and [[Dean DeBlois]] from a screenplay by [[William Davies (screenwriter)|Will Davies]], Sanders, and DeBlois, and stars the voices of [[Jay Baruchel]], [[Gerard Butler]], [[Craig Ferguson]], [[America Ferrera]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]], [[T. J. Miller]], and [[Kristen Wiig]]. The story takes place in a mythical [[Vikings|Viking]] world where a young Viking teenager named Hiccup aspires to follow his tribe's tradition of becoming a [[dragon]] slayer. After finally capturing his first dragon, and with his chance at last of gaining the tribe's acceptance, he finds that he no longer wants to kill the dragon and instead befriends it.

The film premiered at the [[Universal Amphitheater|Gibson Amphitheater]] on March 21, 2010,<ref name="HTTYDPremiere" /> and was released in the United States five days later on March 26. The film was a critical and commercial success, earning praise from film critics and audiences and earning nearly $500 million worldwide. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] at the [[83rd Academy Awards]], but lost to ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' and ''[[The Social Network]]'', respectively. ''How to Train Your Dragon'' also won ten [[Annie Awards]], including [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]].

Two sequels, ''[[How to Train Your Dragon 2]]'' and ''[[How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World]]'', were released on June 13, 2014, and February 22, 2019, respectively. Much like their predecessor, both sequels were widely praised and became box office successes. The film's success has also inspired other merchandise, including a [[How to Train Your Dragon (video game)|video game]] and a [[DreamWorks Dragons|television series]].

== Plot ==
The [[Vikings|Viking]] village of Berk, located on a remote island, is attacked frequently by dragons, which take livestock and damage property. Hiccup, the awkward fifteen-year-old son of the village chieftain, Stoick the Vast, is deemed too scrawny and weak to fight the dragons, so he instead creates mechanical devices under his apprenticeship with Gobber, the village blacksmith, though Hiccup's inventions often backfire. During one attack, Hiccup uses a [[bolas]] launcher to shoot down a Night Fury, a dangerous and rare dragon of which little is known, but no one believes him, so he searches for the fallen dragon on his own. He finds the dragon in the forest, tangled in his net, but cannot bring himself to kill it, and instead sets it free.

Stoick assembles a fleet to find the dragons' nest, and enters Hiccup in a dragon-fighting class with Astrid, Fishlegs, Snotlout, Ruffnut, Tuffnut, and taught by Gobber, to train while he is away. Hiccup returns to the forest and finds the Night Fury still there, unable to fly because Hiccup's bolas tore off half of its tail fin. Hiccup befriends the dragon, giving it the name 'Toothless'. Feeling guilty for crippling Toothless, Hiccup designs a harness rig and a [[prosthetic]] fin that allow the dragon to fly with Hiccup controlling the prosthetic.

Hiccup learns about dragon behavior as he works with Toothless, and is able to nonviolently subdue all the captive dragons during training, earning him the admiration of his peers, but causing Astrid, a tough Viking girl on whom Hiccup has a crush, to become increasingly suspicious of his behavior. Meanwhile, Stoick's fleet arrives home unsuccessful, though Stoick is cheered by Hiccup's unexpected success in dragon training. Hiccup is judged the winner of his training class, and must kill a dragon for his final exam. He tries to run away with Toothless, only to be followed by Astrid in the forest. Hiccup takes Astrid for a flight to demonstrate that the dragon is friendly. When Astrid reminds Hiccup of the exam, Toothless unexpectedly takes the pair to the dragons' nest, where they discover a gargantuan dragon named the Red Death, which eats the smaller dragons unless they constantly bring it live food; the two realize that the dragons have been attacking Berk under duress. Astrid wishes to tell the village about their discovery, but Hiccup advises against it to protect Toothless. 

Back at the village the next day, Hiccup faces a captive Monstrous Nightmare dragon in his final exam. Instead of killing it, however, he subdues it in an attempt to prove that dragons are peaceful. When Stoick inadvertently angers the dragon into attacking, Toothless arrives to protect Hiccup, but is captured by the Vikings in the process. Hiccup accidentally reveals to Stoick that Toothless knows the location of the dragons' nest; Stoick disowns his son, and sets off for the nest with Toothless chained to the lead ship as a guide. After the Vikings have left, Hiccup is devastated, but Astrid prompts him to come to the realization that he spared Toothless out of compassion and empathy, not weakness. Hiccup then regains his confidence to go after Toothless and save him along with Astrid and the other teens.

The Viking attackers locate and break open the dragon's nest, causing most of the dragons to fly out, but also awakening the Red Death, which soon overwhelms the Vikings. Hiccup, Astrid, and their fellow pupils fly in, riding Berk's captive training dragons, providing cover fire, and distracting the Red Death while Hiccup frees Toothless. Hiccup almost drowns while doing so, but Stoick saves them both, reconciling with his son. Toothless and Hiccup destroy the Red Death by puncturing its wing membranes and then tricking the beast into making a plunge from which it cannot pull up after shooting a fireball into its mouth. Hiccup is injured in the fight, losing his lower left leg. Hiccup awakens back on Berk, finding that Gobber has fashioned him a prosthesis, and he is now admired by his village, especially Astrid, who kisses him. Berk begins a new era, with humans and dragons living in harmony.

== Production ==
[[File:Toothlessconceptart.jpg|thumb|left|Early production concept artwork of "Toothless" and "Hiccup"]]
The book series by [[Cressida Cowell]] began coming to attention to the executives at [[DreamWorks Animation]] in 2004. Coming off her success in ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]'', producer [[Bonnie Arnold]] shortly became interested in the newly acquired property. She kept focusing on the project as time went on, and when DreamWorks Animation co-president of production [[Bill Damaschke]] asked her what she wanted to work on next, she chose "How to Train Your Dragon".<ref>{{cite web|last=Nasson |first=Tim |url=http://www.wildaboutmovies.com/behind_the_scenes/HowToTrainYourDragon-BEHINDTHESCENES.php |title=How To Train Your Dragon&nbsp;— BEHIND THE SCENES |publisher=Wild About Movies |date=March 18, 2010 |accessdate=May 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105114736/http://www.wildaboutmovies.com/behind_the_scenes/HowToTrainYourDragon-BEHINDTHESCENES.php |archivedate=November 5, 2011}}</ref>

During initial development, the plot followed the original novel closely, but about halfway through production [[Chris Sanders]] and [[Dean DeBlois]], previously the writers & directors of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'', took over as co-directors and it was altered. The original plot was described as, "heavily loyal to the book", but was regarded as being too "sweet" and "whimsical" as well as geared towards a too-young demographic, according to Baruchel.<ref name="devusatoday">[https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2009-11-04-how-to-tame-a-dragon_N.htm First look: DreamWorks' 3-D 'How to Train Your Dragon']. ''USA Today''. April 11, 2009. Retrieved November 21, 2010.</ref> In the novel, Hiccup's dragon, Toothless, is a Common or Garden Dragon, a small breed. In the film, Toothless is a Night Fury, the rarest of all dragons, and is large enough to serve as a flying mount for both Hiccup and Astrid. The filmmakers hired cinematographer [[Roger Deakins]] (known for frequently collaborating with [[the Coen brothers]]) as a visual consultant to help them with lighting and overall look of the film and to "add a live-action feel".<ref name="devusatoday"/> Extensive research was done to depict both flight, as the directors knew they would be the biggest draw of the film's 3D effects, and fire, given animation could break away from the limitations seen in live-action films, where [[propane]] flames are usual due to being easier to extinguish. The dragons' design made sure to create animals that were comical and also innovative compared to other dragon fiction. Toothless in particular tried to combine various dragon traits in a [[black panther]]-inspired design, that also had large ears and eyes to convey emotion better.<ref name=tech>"The Technical Artistry of 'Dragon'", ''How to Train Your Dragon'' Blu-ray</ref>

The directors made sure to cash in the improvisation abilities of the secondary cast—Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Jonah Hill, Kristen Wiig and T.J Miller—by frequently bringing them together in the recording sessions.<ref name=cast/>

== Music ==
{{Main|How to Train Your Dragon: Music from the Motion Picture}}
[[John Powell (film composer)|John Powell]] returned to DreamWorks Animation to score ''How to Train Your Dragon'', making it his sixth collaboration with the studio, following his previous score for ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'' (which he scored with [[Hans Zimmer]]). Powell composed an orchestral score, combining bombastic brass with loud percussion and soothing strings, while also using exotic, Scottish and Irish tones with instruments like the [[penny whistle]] and [[bagpipes]]. Additionally, Icelandic singer [[Jón Þór Birgisson|Jónsi]] wrote and performed the song "Sticks & Stones" for the film. The score was released by [[Varèse Sarabande]] on March 23, 2010.

Overall, the score was well received by film score critics. Powell earned his first [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Academy Award]] nomination for his work on the film, ultimately losing to [[Trent Reznor]] and [[Atticus Ross]] for their score for ''[[The Social Network]]''.

=== Competition for 3D screens ===
A month before the release, DreamWorks Animation CEO [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] protested [[Warner Bros.]]' decision to convert ''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' from 2D to 3D, then to release it one week after ''How to Train Your Dragon''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/02/katzenberg-.html |title=Katzenberg angry over Warner's 'Clash of the Titans' 3-D release |author1=Verrier, Richard |author2=Claudia Eller |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=April 1, 2010 |date=February 10, 2010}}</ref> Entertainment reporter Kim Masters described the 3D release schedule around March 2010 as a "traffic jam", and speculated that the lack of 3D screen availability could hurt Katzenberg's prospects despite his support of the 3D format.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125086877 |title=Coming To A Screen Near You: A 3-D Clash |author1=Kim Masters |author2=Renee Montagne |work=Morning Edition |publisher=NPR |accessdate=April 1, 2010 |date=March 21, 2010}}</ref>

In March 2010, theater industry executives accused [[Paramount Pictures]] (who distributed the film on behalf of DreamWorks) of using high-pressure tactics to coerce theaters to screen ''How to Train Your Dragon'' rather than competing 3D releases, ''Clash of the Titans'' and [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. As theater multiplexes often had just one 3D screen, theaters were unable to accommodate more than one 3D presentation at a time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/18/AR2010031806233.html |title='How to Train Your Dragon,' 'Clash of the Titans' clash for 3-D screens |author1=Richard Verrier |author2=Ben Fritz |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=April 1, 2010 |date=March 21, 2010}}</ref>
