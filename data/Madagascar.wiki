'''''Madagascar''''' is a 2005 American [[computer animation|computer-animated]] [[comedy film]] produced by [[DreamWorks Animation]] and distributed by [[DreamWorks Pictures]]. It was directed by [[Eric Darnell]] and [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]] (the latter in his directional debut) from a screenplay by [[Mark Burton (writer)|Mark Burton]], [[Billy Frolick]], Darnell, and McGrath, and features the voices of [[Ben Stiller]], [[Chris Rock]], [[David Schwimmer]], and [[Jada Pinkett Smith]], with [[Sacha Baron Cohen]], [[Cedric the Entertainer]], and [[Andy Richter]] voicing secondary characters. The film's plot revolves around four animals from the [[Central Park Zoo]] who unexpectedly find themselves stranded in Madagascar, and must learn to adapt to the wild.

''Madagascar'' was released to theaters on May 27, 2005. Despite its mixed critical reception, it was a commercial success at the box office. The film launched a [[Madagascar (franchise)|franchise]] with a series of films, including two sequels: ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]'' in 2008 and ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' in 2012, both to more positive reception. A spin-off featuring the series' penguin characters, ''[[Penguins of Madagascar]]'', was released on November 26, 2014.

==Plot==
At the [[Central Park Zoo]], [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Marty|Marty]] the [[Plains zebra|zebra]] is celebrating his 10th birthday, but has grown bored with his daily routine and longs to experience the [[wilderness|wild]]. Marty's best friend is [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Alex|Alex]] the [[lion]], who enjoys showing off for the public and is somewhat self-centered due to his celebrity status as "the King of New York City" attempts to cheer Marty up, but Marty, still unsatisfied, gets some tips from the zoo's [[Adélie penguin|penguin]]s—[[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Skipper|Skipper]], [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Kowalski|Kowalski]], [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Rico|Rico]], and [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Private|Private]]—who are trying to escape the zoo, and follows them out. Alex, [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Melman|Melman]] the [[Reticulated giraffe|giraffe]], and [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Gloria|Gloria]] the [[hippopotamus]] pursue Marty in an attempt to convince him to return. The four, along with the penguins and two [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s named [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Mason and Phil|Mason and Phil]], find themselves at [[Grand Central Terminal]], where they are quickly sedated via [[Tranquillizer gun|tranquillizer]] when Alex's attempt to communicate with humans is mistaken for aggression. The zoo, under pressure from anti-captivity activists, is forced to ship the escaped animals by sea to a [[Kenya]]n wildlife preserve. During their travels, the penguins escape from their enclosure and take over the ship, intent on taking it to [[Antarctica]]. Their antics on the bridge cause the crates containing Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria to fall overboard and wash ashore on [[Madagascar]], because the strap securing the crates broke off due to Alex and Marty fighting.

The animals eventually regroup ashore the beach, initially believing themselves to be at the [[San Diego Zoo]]. Upon exploring, however, they come across a pack of [[lemur]]s, led by [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#King Julien XIII|King Julien XIII]] the [[ring-tailed lemur]], and learn their true location. Alex blames Marty for their predicament and attempts to signal for help to get back to civilization. Marty, on the other hand, finds the wild to be exactly what he was looking for, with Gloria and Melman soon joining him in enjoying the island after getting tired of Alex's arrogance and complaining. Alex, eventually having a change of heart, comes around, but, deprived from the raw [[steak]]s he was provided with at the zoo, his [[prey drive]] begins to show as hunger kicks in. The group is accepted by the lemurs, though Julien's adviser, [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Maurice|Maurice]] the [[aye-aye]], cautions them about Alex's predatory nature. Julien ignores Maurice's concerns and persuades the group to help the lemurs fend off the [[fossa (animal)|fossa]], who hunt the lemurs as prey. While Alex initially scares the fossa away and is worshiped by the lemurs, later, compelled by hunger, he attacks Marty. Realizing that Alex is now a threat, Julien banishes him to the far side of the island where the fossa live. Seeing what has happened to Alex, and how difficult it is to survive with so many predators around the island, Marty regrets his decision to leave the zoo and reflects on the consequences of his impulsive actions.

The penguins, having been to Antarctica and found it not to their liking, land the ship at Madagascar. Seeing this as a chance to return Alex to New York, Marty rushes after his friend against the wishes of Melman and Gloria. Marty attempts to convince the now grizzled, starving Alex to return, but Alex refuses out of fear of attacking Marty again. The penguins, Gloria, and Melman go to find Marty, but are trapped by the fossa. At the last minute, Alex overcomes his predatory instincts and scares the fossa away from the lemur territory forever. The lemurs regain their respect for Alex, and the penguins help him satisfy his hunger through [[sushi]]. As the lemurs throw a farewell celebration for the foursome, the penguins decide not to break the news that the ship has run out of fuel.

==Production==
In 1998, DreamWorks and PDI had started development on an animated film titled ''Rockumentary'' without being formally announced as a parody of [[Beatles|The Beatles]] in a most likely animated [[mockumentary]] of their rise and fall to fame, which featured a [[Beatlesque|Beatles-esque]] penguin rock band. The idea was scrapped, but after production on ''Madagascar'' started, director [[Eric Darnell]] decided to revive the penguins, but make them a commando unit instead of a [[rock band]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Escape from Zoo-York: Behind The Scenes of Madagascar|url=http://www.skwigly.co.uk/behind-the-scenes-of-madagascar/|date=November 25, 2005}}</ref>
